	<p><b>Overview.</b>
	HTML 4.0 is the current HTML standard that describes what HTML is and how it should be used.  This standard is important in that
	it describes a subset of all the current browser features that will work on every conforming browser, including
	the most recent versions of Internet Explorer (4.0 and higher) and Firefox (2.0 and higher).  Standards are important
	in that they allow HTML authors and HTML application developers to agree on a common syntax that works across the internet.
	</p>
	<p><b>Reference.</b>
	Our reference for this standard is &quot;HTML The Definitive Guide Third Edition&quot; by Musciano and Kennedy, an O&#039;Reilly
	&amp; Associates book.  This excellent reference includes many useful examples.  The remainder of this document highlights
	selected sections of this standard that applies to our situation.
	</p>
	<p><b>Tools.</b>
	The two essential ingredients to establishing a documentation standard are a comprehensive reference and a tool for automated
	validation of our generated documents.  Fortunately, both are available for HTML.  HomeSite 5.5 from Macromedia
	provides three important features, composition, spell-checking, and validation.  This tool should be used to validate all
	HTML documents.

	<p><b>Overview.</b>
	This section highlights and emphasizes selected aspects of the HTML 4.0 standard as described in the above reference. Several
	examples are included here that further document some of the more subtle portions of the standard that require clarification.
	The section numbers shown below correspond to the sections in the HTML reference. We start with an HTML snippet that
	violates the standard followed by a correct version.

	<p><b>3.3 HTML Tags.</b>
	A &quot;tag&quot; is the portion of the text between the less-than character (&lt;) and greater-than (&gt;) character.
	A &quot;tag name&quot; and zero or more attributes may be included between these angle brackets. Some nomenclature is shown
	in the following list:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Tag Name.  A lower-case key-word.  A list of permitted tag names are listed in Appendix B. Other names are
		not allowed.</li>
		<li>Attribute Name.  A lower-case key-word.  A list of permitted attributes within eacy tag are listed in Appendix
		B.  Other attribute names are not allowed.</li>
		<li>Attribute Value. Some attribute names may be followed by an equal sign (=) and a value.  The value may
		be a keyword, a number or a string.  Only strings are enclosed in quotes(&quot;).</li>
		<li>Closing tag. Most tags have a closing tag noted by a slash (/) following the less-than (&lt;) character.
		HTML tags with no end tag are listed in Section 3.3.5 of the HTML reference.</li>
		<li>Segment. A &quot;segment&quot; is the entire text between the beginning of a tag to the end of the closing
		tag.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Well-Formed HTML.</b>
	As noted in the XML Programming Guidelines, it is not difficult to compose HTML documents that are also XML compatible.
	Specifically, the XHTML standard requires tag names to be lower case, an end tag for every start tag, and attribute values
	enclosed in quotes.  It makes sense to generalize our guidelines so that our HTML documents can be processed using XML tools.
	For a complete list of requirements, see Chapter 7 or our XML reference.
	The guidelines for composing tags are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Case. Tag names and attribute names must be in lower case.</li>
		<li>End Tags. Every start tag must be followed by an end tag.</li>
		<li>Attribute Values. Surround all attribute values with quotes.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>3.5 Document Type Definition (DTD).</b>
	Every HTML page should conform to the HTML SGML DTD that defines the HTML 4.0 standard.  It is important to inform browsers and
	validation tools that each page conforms to this standard by including the following DTD declaration at the beginning of every
	page as shown in the Well-Formed page shown above.
	</p>
	<p><b>4.10 Character Entities.</b>
	Some characters are reserved by HTML for defining tags and special characters. Other characters whose codes exceed 127
	are considered special.  These special characters should be encoded as character entities.  A list of special characters
	is shown in Appendix E.  A list of reserved characters for use in a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) are noted in
	section 7.2.
	</p>
	<p><b>4.6.3 Deprecated Tags.</b>
	Deprecated tags are tags that have been replaced by new constructs.  They may not be supported in the future and they
	represent an old implementation that has been made obsolete by new, improved options.  The FONT tag is one of the
	deprecated tags that has been replaced by styles which allow a more uniform  look and feel that can be easily adapted
	without massive changes to the existing HTML documents.  Separation of the format from the content is central to
	constructing reference documentation that can adapt to a variety of end-uses.
	</p>
	<p>A list of deprecated tags are included in the Summary below.  The same rationale applies to deprecated attributes that can
	create a formatting nightmare.  In the above examples, the Well-Formed version shows how it is possible to set the format
	of all of the H4 headers or List Elements of a page in one place.  Compare this simple situation with making a formatting
	change to the ill-formed page.  Every tag must be examined and modified in the entire document.  A list of deprecated
	attributes are shown in the Summary below.
	</p>
	<p><b>Appendix A. Nesting Rules.</b>
	Not just any tag can be included in the body of another tag.  For example, only the LI tag is allowed in a UL segment.
	A complete list of which tags are allowed in other tags is found in Appendix A of the HTML reference.  Guidance on the
	appropriate use of tags is provided by the validation tool described above.
	</p>
	<p><b>Summary.</b>
	The HTML guidelines include the following recommendations:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>HTML Tags. Tag names and attribute names shall be in lower case.  Attribute values are enclosed in quotes.</li>
		<li>Document Type Definition. Note DTD in an SGML command on the first line.</li>
		<li>Character Entities. Use character entities for all reserved characters such as less-than, greater-than, and quote.</li>
		<li>Deprecated Tags. Do not use deprecated tags such as S, STRIKE, U, BASEFONT, FONT, CENTER,LISTING,PLAINTEXT, or XMP.</li>
		<li>Deprecated Attributes. Do not use deprecated attributes such as ALIGN, COLOR.</li>
		<li>Nesting Rules. Observe the nesting rules as described in Appendix A. For example, the UL tag may not appear in a P
		segment. A TITLE tag can only appear in a HEAD segment.</li>
		<li>Style Sheets. Use styles to set the documentation format.</li>
	</ul>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><INPUT TYPE='button' VALUE='Top of Page' onClick='navigate("#TOP");'></P><P><H2><A NAME="S3"></A>HTML Styles</H2></P>
	<p><b>Style Management.</b>
	Suppose that we want to impose a uniform look and feel to the help documentation for a particular application. Or, suppose
	that we wish to render the presentation for a variety of end-uses (print, web, pda, etc.).  Or suppose that we wish to
	have one group compose the help text and another group format the end-user presentation.  All of these tasks are facilitated
	by separating the formatting from the meta-data and content of the help documents.  Fortunately, HTML provides a straightforward
	mechanism for separating the formatting from the content.
	</p>
	<p><b>9.0 Style Sheets</b></p>
	<p><b>Summary.</b>
	The HTML style guidelines are described in Chapter 9 of our HTML reference.  An example of using styles is shown in the
	well-formed HTML shown above. One rule in the style segment sets the color of the H4 headers and a second rule sets the font
	size of the list elements. To change the color or the size requires a simple change in just one spot.  Compare that
	option to changing every H4 tag or every LI tag in the entire document.
	</p>
	<p><b>9.5.2 External Styles.</b>
	The above example shows a document-level style in the head segment of an HTML document.  It is also possible to set the
	styles for an entire set of documents in a single separate file.  The pros and cons of these two approaches are noted in
	Chapter 9 of the HTML reference.  We adopt the following recommendations made by the authors:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Document-level Styles.  Use document-level styles to set those rules that impact three or fewer documents.</li>
		<li>External Styles.  Move document-level rules to an external style sheet file when a rule will impact more than three
		documents.</li>
		<li>Inline Styles.  Inline styles are not recommended.</li>
	</ul>
