In order to help you we need your help.
When submitting a report, please help us reproduce the problem by including the following:
 * Clear, detailed description of the problem/question/suggestion. 
 * Version of AIS you are using (e.g. 1.0053) 
 * Operating environment (OS, hardware, AIS configuration).  (You can do this once and
   then copy it into subsequent reports). 
 * A brief, self-contained program demonstrating the problem. Please include instructions
   on the steps required to set the stage for running the program (note any required
   libraries, projects, config files, ...).

Your detailed report will allow us to make a prompt and accurate response.
