			<h3>3.1.1 Overview</h3>
			<p>
			The Find dialog allows users to search for a pattern in the edit text.  The desired pattern is entered into the Find
			text box or selected from the drop-down combo box at the top of the dialog.  Click on the Find button on the right
			or press Enter to conduct the next search. Click on the Quit button to close the dialog.  See section 5 of this
			guide for a detailed discussion of searching.</p>
			<p>
			Messages appear in the status bar at the bottom of the dialog that are of help in guiding the search.  Three
			button groups allow users to select several options, a search region, and a search direction. A discussion of
			each Group is shown next.</p>
			<h3>3.1.2 Options</h3>
			<p>
			<b>Match Words</b>
			See the discussion in section 1 on words. Match Words restricts the match to start and to end on a
			word boundary.  Thus &quot;space&quot; will not match &quot;backspace&quot;.  The pattern does not have to
			contain just alphanumeric characters.  Thus &quot;::back space&quot will match &quot;the ::back space&quot;
			because the matching text starts and ends on a word boundary.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Match Case</b> If Match Case is checked, the search is case-sensitive.  In this <i>case</i>, &quot;BackSpace&quot;
			does not match &quot;backspace&quot;.  If Match Case is not checked they would match.  Match Case only applies to
			the letters from A thru Z.</p>
			
			<p><b>RegularExp</b> If RegularExp is checked, the pattern entered in the Find text box is treated as a
			regular expression.  Regular expressions are discussed in section 5 below.</p>
			
			<h3>3.1.3 Search Direction.</h3>
			<p>
			Unlike the check boxes, one, and only one, radio button in this group can be selected.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Down</b> If Down is selected the search begins at the first row of the search region.  Each row is searched
			for a match from left to right.  If a partial row is included in the search region, only the portion of the
			row in the selected region is searched.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Up</b> If Up is selected, the search begins at the last row of the search region.  Each row is searched
			for a match from the end to the left.  If a partial row is included in the search region, only the portion of the
			row in the selected region is searched.  Searching up is slower than searching down.  If the direction is
			not important to you, select Down.</p>
			
			<h3>3.1.4 Search Region.</h3>
			Just as with the Direction button group, one, and only one, radio button in the group can be selected.
			<p>
			<b>Selection</b> If several lines are currently selected when the dialog is opened, the search region is
			restricted to the selected text.  This search region remains in effect until the last match is made in this
			region or until another region is selected from this group.</p>
			<p>
			<b>At End</b> If searching Down, the search region extends from the current cursor position to the end
			of the text.  If searching Up, the search region extends from the current cursor position to the beginning
			of the text.  This option is especially attractive if you want to be notified when a complete pass has been
			made through the text.</p>
			<p>
			<b>All Text</b> The search extends from the current cursor position and extends to the entire text.  This
			option is somewhat distinctive in that it is not possible to ever hit the end of the search region.  That is,
			the next find can always be conducted even if no match was made on the last attempt.</p>
			<p>
			<b>More Information.</b>
			Much more detailed information on searching is found in section 5.</p>

			<h3>3.2.1 Overview</h3>
			While editing a document, the &quot;function list&quot; or &quot;agent list&quot; dialog can be shown by depressing the
			Ctrl key and then pressing the right button on your pointing device, typically a mouse. The dialog shows a list of the
			functions or agents in the current document. Each entry in the list shown contains two fields.  The first one is the
			line number and the second is the function name.  You can do any of the following:
			<ul>
				<li>Select.  Highlight one item in the list by clicking on it and then press the select button to move to that function in
				the source code.</li>
				<li>Double-click.  As an alternative, you can also double-click on an item in the list to move to that function.</li>
				<li>Cancel.  Press cancel to dismiss the dialog and return to editing the document.</li>
				<li>Sort.  Click in either header to re-sort the list on the column selected.  An up-arrow indicates that the list is
				is sorted in ascending order.  A down-arrow indicates that the list is sorted in descending order on that list.
				The column and the sort order are reset the next time that the dialog is opened.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>3.2.2 Function Definitions</h3>
			The definition of a function for each language is shown in the following table.  The meta-symbol &lt;fcnname&gt; refers to
			an arbitrary function name that appears in the &quot;Function&quot; column of the function list. The meta-symbol
			&lt;def...&gt; stands for any one of the following: defun, defchild, defriend, deforphan.  The meta-symbol
			&lt;type&gt> refers to any sequence of non-space characters. The ellipsis ... stands for any sequence of characters except
			a closing parenthesis.

		    <div class="h2section" id="3.3 Goto Dialog">
			<p>The Goto dialog allows users to move to a line in the edit text.  Enter the line number in the &quot;Go To&quot;
			edit box and then click on Go.  The cursor is moved to the designate line in the edit text.  Click on Close
			to dismiss the dialog.  If the line number exceeds the number of lines in the text, the cursor is moved

			  <h3>3.4.1 Overview</h3>
			<img src="Image_EdReplaceDialog.gif" width=336 height=217 align=right alt="Replace Dialog" border=0>
			<p>
			<b>Find.</b> The Replace dialog allows users to search for a pattern in the edit text and to replace previously matched text with
			new text.  Enter the desired search pattern into the Find text box or select an existing pattern from the drop-down
			Find combo box shown in the diagram on the right.  Click on the Find button on the top, right side of the dialog
			or press Enter to conduct a next search.  The Find capability is nearly identical to that of the Find dialog.  Please
			consult section 3.1 on the Find Dialog for more details. The major difference is that the Find Dialog allows searches
			up from the end of the search region.  Searches in the Replace Dialog are always conducted from the current top of the
			search region towards the end of the search region.  Consult section 5 below for more details on search and
			replace.</p>
			
			<p>
			<b>Replace.</b> Enter the text to be replace the current match in the Replace text box just below the find text box
			in the dialog shown on the right.  You may also select a previous replace string from the drop-down combo box.
			Click on the Replace button to replace the currently matched text and then to search for the next
			match with the current Find pattern.  The next search is conducted from the current cursor position to the end of the
			search region.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Replace All.</b> Click on the Replace All button to replace all of the matches in the current search region
			with the replace text.  If some text is selected, the selected text remains selected.  Else, the last match in
			the search region is selected.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Options.</b> The options are described in section 3.1 on the the Find Dialog.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Search Region.</b> The search region is described in section 3.1 on the Find Dialog.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Messages.</b>  Messages appear in the status bar at the bottom of the dialog that are of help in guiding the search.  Three
			button groups allow users to select several options, a search region.</p>

			 <img src="Image_EdSetTabDialog.gif" width=223 height=197 align=right alt="Tabstop Dialog" border=0>
			<h3>3.5.1 Overview</h3>
			<p>
			Use this dialog to convert leading spaces to tabs or to convert leading tabs to spaces.  To convert spaces to tabs, select
			the rows to be modified in the edit text and then press Ctrl-T to bring up the dialog shown on the right. The number of
			spaces-per-tab may be entered into the &quot;Spaces per Tab&quot; spin box. Then click on the &quot;Tabify&quot; button to
			convert leading spaces into tabs.  Similarly, click on the &quot;Detab&quot; button to convert leading tabs into spaces.
			A mixture of leading spaces and tabs is handled gracefully as noted below.  Changes to the file cannot be undone using
			undo.</p>
			
			<h3>3.5.2 Extra Spaces</h3>
			<p>
			The ExtraSpaces option only applies when the Tabify button is clicked.  After each set of spaces-per-tab leading spaces are
			converted to tabs, zero up to one less than the tabwidth spaces might be left over.  There are three ways to deal with
			these leftover spaces:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Keep.  Tack the extra spaces onto the end of the last tab.  The first character in the row will not line up with
				a tabstop</li>
				<li>Tab.  Replace the extra spaces with one extra tab.  The first character in the row will line up with the next
				tabstop.</li>
				<li>Delete. Discard the extra spaces. The first character in the row will line up with a tabstop.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>3.5.3 Tabify</h3>
			<p>
			A selected row is only modified if it contains one or more spaces.  The steps in processing the leading spaces in one
			row are: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Count the number and the total width of the leading spaces and tabs.</li>
				<li>Compute the number of tabs required to span the same width and compute the number of extra spaces left over.</li>
				<li>Based upon the current ExtraSpaces option, adjust the number of leading tabs and extra spaces in the row.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h3>3.5.4 Detab</h3>
			<p>
			A selected row is only modified if it contains one or more tabs.  The steps in processing the leading tabs in one
			row are: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Count the number and the total width of the leading spaces and tabs.</li>
				<li>Compute the number of spaces required to span the same width.</li>
				<li>Replace the existing tabs with the number of spaces required to span the same width.</li>
			</ol>

			 <img src="Image_EdTestSuiteDialog.gif" width=453 height=238 align=right alt="Test Suite Dialog" border=0>
			<h3>3.6.1 Overview</h3>
			<p>
			This editor has a built-in test facility that uses the Applications Programming Interface (API) described in section 8
			below.  Press Ctrl-Shift-F5 to bring up the Test Suite Dialog shown on the right.  Any edit operation that can
			be performed from key strokes, pointing devices, or other dialogs mentioned in this section can be included
			in the test suite.  When the edit test suite is launched, a test file is read to generate a set of edit operations.
			These edit operations are translated into edit commands and submitted to the AisEd API.  The results of the
			edit commands are displayed in the current edit Page.</p>
			<p>
			This dialog is provided for advanced users only.  Running a test suite may overwrite existing files. You were
			warned.</p>
			
			<h3>3.6.2 Cmd</h3>
			<p>
			An edit operation may be entered into the Cmd Text Box.  The format of the edit operation is described in detail
			in the edit test suite file.  The edit commands are described in section 8 below on the AisEd API.  After entering
			the operation, click on the Go button to execute the edit operation.
			When running a sequence of operations from a test file, after the next operation is executed, it is displayed in
			this Text Box.</p>
			
			<h3>3.6.3 Next and Prev</h3>
			<p>
			Click on the Next button to execute the operation shown in the Next Text Box.  The results of the operation, if any,
			are displayed in the editor.  After the edit operation is performed, the operation is displayed in the
			Cmd Text Box and the next pending operation is shown in the Next Text Box.</p>
			<p>
			Click on the Go button to re-execute the current operation shown in the Cmd Text Box.</p>
			<p>
			Click on the Prev button to re-execute the previous operation (not shown).  The results of the operation, if any,
			are displayed in the editor.  The operation in the Cmd Text Box is moved back to the Next Text Box and the previous operation
			that was just re-executed is moved back into the Cmd Text Box.</p>
			<h3>3.6.4 Run</h3>
			<p>
			Click on the Run button to continuously execute the operations in the test suite from the test shown in Next until the end
			of the test suite or the next stop directive is reached.  If the test suite is run from the C++ debugger, a breakpoint can
			be placed in the beep() function which is common to all the checking functions.  If any errors occur during the execution
			of the test suite, they will very likely cause a red alert in the editor or an error message in the debugger.</p>
			<h3>3.6.5 Restart</h3>
			<p>
			Click on the Restart button to re-read the test suite file and restart the tests over.  To make changes to the test suite
			on the fly, just edit the test suite file and then press Restart.</p>
