	<p><b>Overview.</b>
	XML 1.1 is the current XML standard that describes what XML is and how it should be used.  This standard is important in that
	it describes the requirements for interoperating with a wide variety of applications including modern browsers, Macromedia's
	Flash MX, and X3D. Standards are important in that they allow XML authors and XML applications to agree on a common syntax that
	improves reliability and maintenance.  It ensures that our XML documents will work with these applications, development
	environments and validation tools.  Note that XML parsers are not allowed to fix or ignore errors in XML documents.  The
	standard requires the XML parser to report errors.
	</p>
	<p><b>Reference.</b>
	Our reference for this standard is &quot;XML In a Nutshell Third Edition&quot; by Harold and Means, an O&#039;Reilly
	&amp; Associates book.  This excellent reference includes many useful examples.  The remainder of this document highlights
	selected sections of this standard that apply to our situation.  A second reference, &quot;Definitive XML Schema Second
	Edition&quot; by Walmsley is also a recommended supplement to the main XML reference.
	</p>
	<p><b>Tools.</b>
	The two essential ingredients to establishing a documentation standard are a comprehensive reference and a tool for automated
	validation of our generated documents.  Fortunately, both are available for XML.  For now, we use Internet Explorer 6 to validate
	XML documents.  Simply enter the path to the XML file in the IE address bar.  The file should have an .xml file extension.
	Several other XML validation tools are under consideration.

	<p><b>Overview.</b>
	This section highlights and emphasizes selected aspects of the XML 1.1 standard as described in the above reference. XML
	documents should conform to two separate requirements.  XML documents must be well-formed and valid.  Well-formed documents
	meet the requirements described in the section below.  Valid documents conform to a separate Document Type Definition (DTD)
	or a schema.  A DTD describes what elements may appear and where they may appear as well as prescribing their attributes
	and contents.
	</p>
	<p><b>Well-Formed XML</b>
	The well-formed XML requirements are noted in Chapter 21 of the XML reference.  A few of the essential requirements are
	summarized here:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>XML Declaration. The very first thing in every XML document is a declaration such as:<br/>
		&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&lt;</li>
		<li>End Tag.  Every start tag must have a matching end tag or it must be an empty-element tag (ending in /&gt;).</li>
		<li>Nested Tags. Inner tags must be closed before an outer tag is closed.</li>
		<li>Root Element. There must be a single root element.</li>
		<li>Attribute Value. Every attribute value must be quoted.</li>
		<li>Attribute Names. An element cannot contain two attributes with the same name. Attribute names are case-sensitive.</li>
		<li>Comments.  Comments and processing instructions cannot occur inside a tag.</li>
		<li>Special Characters.  Less-than (&lt;), greater-than(&gt;) or ampersand (&amp;) characters in the character
		data of an element or attribute value must be replaced by their respective predefined entitites.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Validation.</b>
	In addition to being well-formed, XML documents usually conform to a syntax that includes the what tags are allowed, where
	they are allowed, their attributes and the contents of each element.  A Document Type Definition (DTD) makes these
	expectations concrete.  An XML document is said to be &quot;valid&quot; if it conforms to a DTD that is specified in
	a Document Type Declaration  (not to be confused with a Document Type Definition!).   This declaration is placed just
	after the XML declaration which is always the first item in any well-formed document. Chapter 3 of the XML reference
	describes the XML validation process in detail.

	<p><b>XHTML Standard.</b>
	XHTML is a W3C standard for a variant of HTML that is XML-compatible.  That is, it defines HTML as an XML-type document rather
	than as an SGML-type document.  It looks a lot like HTML. XHTML includes the requirements of HTML 4.0 plus additional
	requirements set forth in Chapter 7 of our XML reference. XHTML allows an application to process HTML using XML tools.
	Note that XHTML does not include any other tags than those specified by HTML 4.0.  A few of the essential requirements
	are repeated here:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>HTML 4.0. Document meets the requirements included in the HTML 4.0 standard.</li>
		<li>HTML Tags. Tag names and attribute names must be lower case versions of HTML tags and HTML attributes.
		Every start tag must have an end tag or it must be converted to an empty-element tag (a tag that concludes with /&gt;).
		For example, replace &lt;br&gt; with &lt;br/&gt; and &lt;hr&gt; with &lt;hr/&gt;</li>
		<li>Nested Tags.  Inner tags must be closed before an outer tag is closed.  Observe the nesting rules for all HTML tags.
		For example, a UL tag is not allowed in a P segement.  See the HTML reference Appendix A for a complete list of
		nesting rules.</li>
		<li>Attribute Values. Attribute values must be enclosed in quotes (&quot;). Every attribute must have a value.
		For example, replace the boolean attribute checked with checked=&quot;checked&quot;.</li>
		<li>Special Characters.  In HTML some special characters are represented by HTML entities that are not recognized
		in XML.  Convert these HTML entities into XML character entitites.  For example, change &amp;nbsp; to &amp;#160;.
		See Table 27-4 in the XML reference for a complete list.  Encode the special characters less-than, greater-than,
		ampersand and quote in the content of each tag.</li>
		<li>DTD. The root element tag name must be &quot;html&quot;.  Include a DOCTYPE declaration that references of the
		three XHTML DTDs.  See Chapter 7 of the XML reference for a example converting HTML into XHTML.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><b>Style Management.</b>
	Suppose that we want to impose a uniform look and feel to the help documentation for a particular application. Or, suppose
	that we wish to render the presentation for a variety of end-uses (print, web, pda, etc.).  Or suppose that we wish to
	have one group compose the help text and another group render the end-user presentation.  All of these tasks are facilitated
	by separating the formatting from the meta-data and content of the help documents.  Fortunately, XML provides several
	mechanisms for separating the formatting from the content which are described in our XML reference. One approach is
	to use style sheets similar to the HTML style sheets described in the HTML Documentation Guidelines.
	</p>
	<p><b>Style Sheets</b></p>
	<p><b>Summary.</b>
	XML style sheets are described in Chapter 13 of our XML reference. The reference includes a small example that consists
	of two files, an XML document and a CSS style sheet.  The style sheet sets a default format for all of the tags in the
	XML document and then overrides that format for a selected subset of the elements in the XML document.  An XML-aware
	browser, such as Internet Explorer 6.0, will render the document just as shown in the XML reference.
	<!-- We could provide a link to the example here... -->
	</p>
	<p><b>Summary.</b>
	The XML guidelines include the following recommendations:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Well-formed. All XML documents must be well-formed.</li>
		<li>Validation. XML documents should conform to a DTD.</li>
		<li>XHTML. XML-compatible versions of HTML documents must conform to the XHTML standard.</li>
	</ul>
