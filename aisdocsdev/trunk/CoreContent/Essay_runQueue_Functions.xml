		<Description><![CDATA[
		<p>The runQueue lambda implements a peer to peer architecture 
           which can be used to submit jobs from anywhere and which 
           can be used to accept and run jobs from anywhere. At an extreme, 
           to make a point, this would even include submitting a job 
           to runQueue and accepting the same job or another job, 
           via runQueue, from the same running context. Contexts 
           which submit jobs to runQueue for execution are called 
           <b>suppliers</b>, while contexts which accept jobs from runQueue 
           for execution are called <b>subscribers</b>.</p>

        <p>This architecture is currently implemented on a local area  
           network of computers and may be implemented with slight variations
           in a cloud computing environment.</p>

        <p>The runQueue Lambda, which is designed to be open source, 
           provides added value through its job management API, through 
           its console management API, via the thin job execution services 
           it provides, and via the function hiding design of its API (ideally, 
           if possible, the API design should not change regardless of a Network 
           File Sharing implementation, a TCP/IP implementation, or a Cloud 
           implementation). By far the most extensive value added will be provided
           by several function/class libraries providing remote execution services 
           for specific applications. The function library will provide services
           for automatic data-matrix extraction, multiple regression distribution
           and re-accumulation, multiple regression reporting, trader lambda
           memoization (defaulting/learning/promotion) providing support of portfolio
           and factor research.</p>

        <p>It is possible for the runQueue Lambda to function without requiring 
           the user to study any of the available function/class libraries. 
           All jobFiles contain actual source code for the distributed work task 
           (unnamed lambda values to avoid unwanted side affects). These work tasks 
           may be completely stand alone or they may extend existing function/class 
           libraries. Thus runQueue will provide much of its added value in a non 
           restrictive manner.</p>

		<Description><![CDATA[
		<p>The <b>submit</b> function writes a set of job configuration files to
		  the JobQueue. The resulting filenames are based on the jobConfig structure.
          The jobConfig structure must conform to the job config specifications.
          The jobData and jobLambda are both strings which will be compiled and
          evaluated by the subscriber. If present, the fourth parameter tells submit
          to return an error if there are any jobs in the JobQueue with the specified
          job name.</p>

			must be specified in the job configuration so the subscriber will be able
			to reasonably determine whether or not to accept the job.</p>
