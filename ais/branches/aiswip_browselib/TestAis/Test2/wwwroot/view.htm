<B>Introduction.</B>
This page is a place holder for the Application's HTML home page. An application, such as
DeepGreen, can provide a set of HTML formatted reports that are available for viewing.
When a user selects the "View" tool button on the console tab in the session window of the
AIS GUI, a browser is launched (the browser is currently determined by the ClientBrowser
entry in the abase.ini file). The browser opens the home page for the application as
determined by the ClientViewUrl also specified in the abase.ini file.  In this case,
that URL selects this page.
<P>
<B>Help</B>
<UL>
	<LI>To select another home page for your application, edit the ClientViewUrl entry
	in the abase.ini file.  The
	abase.ini file is either in the same directory as the executable file for AIS
	(webide.exe), or it is in the same directory as	the startup.sl file that launched
	this application.  If abase.ini appears in both directories, the entries
	in the abase.ini in the startup.sl directory take precedence.
	</LI>
	<LI>To select another browser, edit the ClientBrowser entry in the ais.ini.  Be sure to avoid spaces
	in the path. Use the 8 character (DOS) names in order to avoid a space in the directory name.
	</LI>
	<LI>To modify the path to the help pages, edit the ClientHelpUrl.  Note the above
	caution about spaces in the file specification.</LI>
