	<Description><![CDATA[
		<p>When evaluated, this vm instruction either starts or stops the AIS Lisp Just-In-Time 
		compiler from generating all Assembler register instructions in hardware mode.
    	</p>      
		<p>Issuing a (vmregRunInHardware start:) instruction causes as many register variables as possible,
		 between this (vmregRunInHardware start:) instruction, and the next (vmregRunInHardware stop:) instruction,
		 to be loaded into actual host hardware registers from their memory placeholder locations. 
		Issuing a (vmregRunInHardware stop:) instruction causes all registers, previously loaded into actual host
		 hardware registers to be saved back into their memory placeholder locations. In between the 
		(vmregRunInHardware start:) and (vmregRunInHardware stop:) instructions, the AIS Lisp compiler allows only a 
		very restricted set of register instructions. The Just-In-Time compiler generates all code for these register 
		instructions to use the actual host hardware registers. There are no conversions made between different types. 
		This instruction may return an Error value. After the operation, the Instruction Pointer is promoted. 
		The operation of this vm instruction is expressed in the following pseudo code:
       		<ul><li><b>  start: {0} (As many declared registers as possible, are loaded into hardware registers.)  </b></li></ul>
			<ul><li><b> stop: {1} (Any declared registers, previously loaded into hardware, are saved back into memory.)   </b></li></ul>
