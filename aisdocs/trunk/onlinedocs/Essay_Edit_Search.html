			<h3>Overview </h3>
			<p>
			Searching is done row by row.  A row is tested for a match with the pattern.  If a match is found, the search
			stops on the first match in the row.  If not, the next row is searched and so on until the end of the search
			region is reached.  The search can be conducted from the beginning of the search region to the end or from the
			end of the search region backwards.  If the search region includes only a partial row, only the portion of the
			row included in the search region is tested for a match.</p>
			<p>
			You can simply enter a pattern in the Find combo box and then press Return to search for the next match starting
			from the beginning of the specified search region.
			Press return a second time to dismiss the dialog and then press F3 (search down) or Shift-F3 (search up)
			to find the next match.   Check the &quot;Match Words&quot; check box to search for patterns that start and end
			on a word boundary.  Check the &quot;Match Case&quot; check box if you wish to make the search case
			sensitive.  If the &quot;Regular Exp&quot; box is checked, the pattern in the Find combo box is treated as
			a regular expression.  Select the Up radio button in to search from the end of the search region upward.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Repeat Search.</b> Each time that a match is found the cursor moves down, (or up if Up selected) in the region
			to the next match and the matched text is selected.  Each subsequent search starts its search from the last match.
			In the case of searching backwards, the search starts from one character to the left of the last match in order to
			avoid rematching the same text.  The search terminates when the search reaches the end of the search region.</p>
			<p>
			If the search fails, you can modify the pattern, the search options, the search region, and the search direction and
			continue the search.  Note that messages appear at the bottom of the find dialog box and also on the status bar to
			guide your search.  If the search fails and the Find Dialog has been dismissed, you can press Ctrl-F3 to extend the
			search region to the entire text.</p>
			
			<h3>5.1.1 Search Region</h3>
			<p>
			The search region may be set to one of three options shown in the Region button group in the Find dialog.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Selection</b>
			
			Suppose that you want to restrict your search to just one module of the source code.
			First, select a text region of two or more rows that includes the module to be searched.  Then open the Find Dialog
			and choose the Selection option in the search Region option group.  The search region extends from the beginning of
			the selected text to the end of the selected text.  If a match is found, the matched text is selected and the cursor
			is moved to the end of the matched text.  Even though the original text region is no longer selected, the
			search region is still in effect until the Region option is not modified.  Subsequent searches will start from the
			current cursor position to the end (or beginning if searching backwards) of the originally selected text.
			The selected region is in effect until the Region option in the Find Dialog is changed or until no more matches
			are found.</p>
			<p>
			<b>To End</b> The To-End option restricts the search region from the current cursor to the end-of-text if
			searching forward (Down Option is selected) or to the beginning-of-text if searching backwards.  A second
			search continues the search from the end of the last match if moving forwards.  The search continues from
			the next to last matched character if searching backwards.</p>
			<p>
			<b>All Text</b>the All-Text option searches from the cursor forward or from the cursor backward.   If the end-of-text
			is reached searching forward, the search continues from the beginning-of-text until the cursor is again reached.
			If the beginning-of-text is reached scanning backwards, the search continues backward in the last row of the text.
			If a match is found, the next search starts from the end of the last match.  If no match is found, the cursor is
			not moved and an alert is emitted.</p>

		    <div class="h2section" id="5.2 Regular Expressions">
			<p>In the find or replace dialogs, a &quot;regular expression&quot; can be entered into the text
			box named Find:.  This regular expression is often referred to as a &quot;pattern&quot;.  Find searches
			each row of text in the document to see if any portion of the row matches the pattern in the text box.
			Although you can turn off regular expression processing by unchecking the &quot;Use Regular Exp.&quot; check box,
			you will learn new ways to employ regular expressions if you use them on a regular basis.        </p>
			<p>
			 After introducing a few essential definitions, regular expressions are defined in the table below.</p>
			
			<h3>5.2.1 Definitions</h3>
			Some of the special lingo used below is defined here.
			<ul>
				<li>ASCII Code.  The numerical code used to represent a letter.  The value is expressed in hexadecimal.  For example,
				the ASCII code for a space character is 0x20.</li>
				<li>Digit.  Any one digit from 0 through 9 inclusive.</li>
				<li>Range. A range of characters, such as [0-9] that represents any one digit.</li>
				<li>Whitespace.  A space (0x20), tab (0x09), or newline (0x0a)</li>
				<li>Word Character.  A letter, digit, or underscore.</li>
				<li>Word. A sequence of word characters.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>5.2.2 Matching Words</h3>
			By selecting the match words check box, the search is restricted to text that not only matches the pattern,
			but also, begins and ends on a word boundary.  The pattern itself can contain word boundaries. Some examples:
			<table  cellspacing=0 border=0 cellpadding=2>
			<tr valign=top>
				<th>Pattern</th>
				<th>Text</th>
				<th>Comments</th>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<td>abc def</td>
				<td>abc def.uvw</td>
				<td>Pattern does match the text because no word character precedes the initial a and a period separates
				def from uvw.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<td>def</td>
				<td>def_uvw</td>
				<td>Pattern does not match the text because a word character (underscore) follows def.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<td>:abc</td>
				<td>x:abc</td>
				<td>Pattern does match the text because the initial colon serves as a word boundary.</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<h3>5.2.3 Elements</h3>
			 In a regular expression, most characters match themselves.  Some special characters with their
			meaning are noted in the following table.  These elements are the basic building block of regular expressions.
			In the examples, => should be read as &quot;matches&quot;.
			<table  cellspacing=0 border=0 cellpadding=2>
			<tr valign=top>
				<th>Element</th>
				<th>Example</th>
				<th>Meaning</th>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>c</th>
				<td>abc => abc in abcd</td>
				<td>Any character except the special characters below match themselves.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>c</th>
				<td>abc => abc in abcd</td>
				<td>Any character except the special characters below match themselves.</td>
				
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>.</th>
				<td>. => 7 in 7.89</td>
				<td>Dot (.) matches any one character.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>\x</th>
				<td>\. => . in 7.89</td>
				<td>When x is a &quot;special&quot; character, use \x to match x where x is one of
				 \, ., ?, *, +, |, ^, $, [, ], (, ), {, }. </td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>\a</th>
				<td>\a => \07 in abc\07 </td>
				<td>Matches the bell character, 0x7.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>\f</th>
				<td>\f => \014 in abc\014</td>
				<td>Matches the form feed character 0x0c.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>\n</th>
				<td>\n => \n in abc\n</td>
				<td>Matches the line feed character, 0x0a.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>\r</th>
				<td>\r => \r in abc\r\n</td>
				<td>Matches the carriage return character, 0x0d.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>\t</th>
				<td>\t => \t in abc\t</td>
				<td>Matches the tab character, 0x09.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>\v</th>
				<td>\v => \013 in abc\013d</td>
				<td>Matches the vertical tab character, 0x0b.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>\d</th>
				<td>\d => 3 in a34c</td>
				<td>Matches one digit.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>\D</th>
				<td>\D => a in 123a</td>
				<td>Matches one non-digit character.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>\0nnn</th>
				<td>\041 => ! in abc!</td>
				<td>Matches the character with a code in octal is nnn where nnn is 0-3 octal digits.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>\s</th>
				<td>\s => \t in abc\t</td>
				<td>Matches one whitespace character.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>\S</th>
				<td>\S => a in abc\n</td>
				<td>Matches one non-whitespace character, 0x0a.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>\w</th>
				<td>\w => a in abc\n</td>
				<td>Matches one word character (alphanumeric character).</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>\W</th>
				<td>\W => \n in abc\n</td>
				<td>Matches a non-word character.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>[ABC],[A-C]</th>
				<td>[A-C] => B in XBC</td>
				<td>Matches one char from the specified range. [ABC] or [A-C] matches A or B or C.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>[^ABC]</th>
				<td>[^ABC] => X in XBC</td>
				<td>Matches any character <i>not</i> in the specified range.  [^ABC] matches any character except A or B or C.</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
			Note that, when specifying a range, a leading caret (^) represents the negation of a class.  An intervening dash
			represents a range.  In the classes of four characters [ABC^] or [-ABC] the tilde and the dash just represent
			themselves.</p>
			
			<h3>5.2.4 Examples</h3>
			The above elements provide a way to represent a single character.  An element may be either represent a specific
			character such as A, B, or C or it may represent one character that belongs to a class of characters such as \d, \w, \s,
			or [A-Z].  As noted below, parentheses may be used to encapsulate a sequence of elements within an expression.
			For  example, in (abc)+ the plus operator applies to &quot;abc&quot; whereas in abc+ the plus just applies to the
			&quot;c&quot;.  Regular expressions combine elements to allow searches for more complex patterns.  When entering
			a pattern in the Find Combo Box, the special characters noted below are shown in dark red.  In the table below,
			E represents a regular expression such as (abc).
			<table  cellspacing=0 border=0 cellpadding=2>
			<tr valign=top>
				<th>Expression</th>
				<th>Example</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>E?</th>
				<td>a\d? => a9 in a999</td>
				<td>E? matches zero or one occurrence of E.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>E+</th>
				<td>\d+ => 789 in 789</td>
				<td>E+ matches one or more occurences of E.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>E*</th>
				<td>7\d* => 789 in 789</td>
				<td>E* matches zero or more occurences of E. Some expression must precede the asterisk.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>E{n}</th>
				<td>\d{2} => 78 in 789</td>
				<td>E{n} matches exactly n occurences of E.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>E{n,}</th>
				<td>\d{2,} => 789 in 789</td>
				<td>E{n,} matches n or more occurences of E.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>E{,m}</th>
				<td>\d{,2} => 78 in 789</td>
				<td>E{,m} matches zero to m occurences of E.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>E{n,m}</th>
				<td>\d{1,3} => 789 in 789</td>
				<td>E{n,m} matches from n up to m occurences of E.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>E|E</th>
				<td>\d|[abc] => b in b789</td>
				<td>E|E matches either the first E or the second E.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>^E</th>
				<td>^X => X in XYZ, but not X in WXYZ</td>
				<td>^E matches E only at the beginning of a row of text.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>E(?=E)</th>
				<td>\d(?=\w+) => 9 in 9ab, but not 9 in 9.ab</td>
				<td>Positive lookahead. E(?=E) matches the first E iff it is followed by the second E.</td>
			</tr><tr valign=top>
				<th>E(?!E)</th>
				<td>\d(?!\w+) => 7 in 7 ab but not 7 in 78ab</td>
				<td>Negative lookahead. E(?!E) matches the first E iff it is not followed by the second E.</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
			Some important precautions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The largest expression is always matched.  For example \d{2,3} will match three digits rather than just two
					if three digits are	available. .* will match everything up to and including the trailing newline in a row.</li>
				<li>Zero-length patterns match nothing. The pattern \d* by itself matches <i>Zero</i> digits. So, for example,
				it matches abc or &amp;%# or whatever.  Every pattern should have at least one element that is not zero length.</li>
				<li>Escape special characters. Put a backslash (\) in front of the characters \, ., ?, *, +, |, ^, $, [, ], (, ), {, } 
				to match the character itself.</li>
				<li>Match words.  If the &quot;Match words&quot; check box is selected, the pattern must begin and end on
				a word boundary.   &quot;b cd&quot; matches &quot;b cd e&quot; but not &quot;ab cd&quot; or &quot;b cde&quot;</li>
				<li>Match case.  If the &quot;Match case&quot; check box is selected, upper case letters in the pattern only
				match upper case letters in the text and vice versa.  Match case only applies to the letters [A-Z] and [a-z].</li>
			</ol>
