				<h3>9.1.1 How do I change the configuration of the editor?</h3>
			Add or copy an aised.ini file, as described above, to the same directory as the one containing the aised.exe file.
			Or, add an environment variable, AISDIR, whose value is the path to a folder containing aised.ini.
			If no aised.ini file is in either directory, the default values for the configurable parameters are used.
			
			<h3>9.1.2 Where can I put the aised.ini file?</h3>
			You can put an aised.ini file in the install directory where the aised.exe file resides.  You can also create
			and AISDIR environment variable with a path such as, C:/ais or user/bin/ais.  If aised cannot find an aised.ini
			file in the install directory, it will look in the folder specified by the value of AISDIR for a copy of aised.ini.
			
			<h3>9.1.3 How do I make AisEd my default text editor?</h3>
			In Windows, the application associated with a file extension can be adjusted using the &quot;Folders Option&quot;
			in the Control Panel.  Select the &quot;File Types&quot; tab and then change the file associated with the
			&quot;Open&quot; command to aised.exe for those extensions associated with text files, e.g., .txt and .ini.
			
			<h3>9.1.4 How do I modify the key used for a command?</h3>
			Currently, the only way to change the command-key bindings is to modify the source code and recompile.  Be
			warned that such changes will invalidate the current editor help and documentation.
			
			<h3>9.1.5 How do I modify the print margins or the page numbering?</h3>
			Currently, the only way to change these printing parameters is to modify the defined constants in the
			AisEd header file and recompile.
			
			<h3>9.1.6 How do I modify the syntax coloring?</h3>
			Currently, the only way to change the colors or parsing of the text is to modify the source code and
			recompile.
			
			<h3>9.1.7 How can I view HTML text?</h3>
			This editor displays HTML tags as plain text.  Modifications could be made to the display portion of the source code
			to render HTML text, but images and hypertext links are not recognized.
			
			<h3>9.1.8 How can the editor operation be verified if a problem is encountered?</h3>
			The editor has a built-in test facility that can run a test suite of your own choosing.  See section 3.6 on the
			test suite dialog for more information.  The challenge is to implement a sequence of tests that explore all the
			nooks and crannies of the code.   The existing test suite starts with a set of edit files and a file containing
			edit operations for each API command.  Each operation file is run against a variety of the edit files.  That way
			every edit operation is tested in several environments to obtain wide coverage.<br>
			For developers, the built-in instrumentation can be turned on by defining ATED_DEBUG to catch any errors generated
			by the test suite.  Finally, BoundsChecker or other C++ checking facility is currently used to catch pointer errors
			or memory leaks not detected by the built-in checks.

		    <div class="h2section" id="9.2 Edit Operations">
			  <h3>9.2.1 How do I undo a massive number of changes that I did not mean to make?</h3>
			The number of undo operations are limited because they consume significant space.  Here are some possible
			ways to undo a large number of insert and/or delete operations:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Undo.</b> If the number of changes is less than the maximum number of saved undo operations, just
				use Ctrl-Z to undo the changes.</li>
				<li><b>Replace.</b> If a distinct sequence of characters are left at each change, the replace dialog will
				allow you to replace this distinct sequence with the original contents.</li>
				<li><b>Exit.</b> If the text has been saved recently, just exit and do not save the recent changes.  Then
				open the document again and you will be back to the last save.</li>
				<li><b>Backup.</b> Restore an earlier version of the document from backup or from the change management
				system, if one is available.  Be careful to not write over an earlier version of the document before
				you have had a chance to retrieve it.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>9.2.2 How do I move back to the previous tab stop?</h3>
			Use the back tab (Shift-Tab) to move back to the previous tab stop.  Make sure that no text is currently
			selected.  Currently, there is no mechanism to move forward to the next tab stop.
			
			<h3>9.2.3 Why does the cursor move left/right when moving the cursor up/down?</h3>
			There are two reasons.  First, the cursor is moved to the beginning column of a tab.  Second,
			the cursor is moved to the end of a short line.  The editor remembers the original column position and
			moves back to the original column position when moving from a short line to a long line.
			
			<h3>9.2.4 How can I move past the end of a line or past the end of the text?</h3>
			The cursor is restricted to move no further than just in front of the last character in a line.  To extend a
			line to the right, just move to the end of the line and then press the space
			bar or the tab key to extend the line to the right.
			<p>
			To extend the text past the last line, move to the end of the text (Ctrl-End) and then press the Enter (or Return)
			key to create a new last line.</p>
			
			<h3>9.2.5 What are some helpful strategies for touch typists?</h3>
			Most touch typists are slowed down when they have to move their hands from their &quot;home&quot; position to
			reach for cursor keys.  Almost every cursor operation has an equivalent Ctrl-Key option.  Memorize these
			alternatives to make editing faster with less strain.  Press F1 to see all the cursor key alternatives.
			
			<h3>9.2.6 How much is a page?</h3>
			A page is just short of the number of lines of the current window (viewport).  Moving up/down by page shows new text
			without skipping any lines.  To increase/decrease the page size, adjust the height of the viewport.  Use Ctrl-UpArrow
			and Ctrl-DownArrow to move a half a page at a time.
			
			<h3>9.2.7 Some edits on a very large file are slow. How to make the edits faster?</h3>
			The following modifications will improve performance:
			<ol>
				<li>Restart. Close the file and reopen it to minimize fragmentation.</li>
				<li>No Language. Change the extension on the file to an extension that is not associated with any language,
				such as txt.  Syntax highlighting requires extra computation.</li>
				<li>No word wrap. Turn off word wrap.  Word wrapping imposes a significant computational overhead.</li>
				<li>No paren matching.  Turn off paren matching.  It requires a scan through the text every time that
				the cursor is moved before an opening bracket or after a closing bracket.</li>
				<li>Reduce undo stack. Reduce the maximum number of saved undo operations to conserve memory.</li>
				<li>No cut or paste.  Cut, copy, and paste are slow on large quantities of text.</li>
				<li>Split the File. If possible, divide the file into several smaller files.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h3>9.2.8 What is the rationale for using control H, J, K and L as substitutes for the arrow keys?
			Why use control I for a tab?</h3>
			Long ago and far away, keyboards had arrows marked on these keys.  Many users still use these keys for moving
			the cursor.  The ASCII code for a tab is Ctrl-I, so this choice matches reality.
			
			<h3>9.2.9 What are some of the ways to move around to various sections in a large file?</h3>
			Several nifty ways to get around:
			<ul>
				<li>Function List Dialog.  Ctrl-RightClick brings up a list of the functions.  Double click on any one
				to go to that function.</li>
				<li>Move to previous cursor. Ctrl-PageUp moves the cursor back to the previous section of code that
				you visited.  After a Ctrl-PageUp,  Ctrl-PageDown moves you back to where you came from.</li>
				<li>Move to other end.  Ctrl-^ moves the cursor to the other end of a hunk of selected text or to the
				other end of matching brackets.  By selecting or matching an entire function, it is possible to move
				to the other end of the function.</li>
				<li>Move to end. Ctrl-Home moves to beginning-of-text and Ctrl-End moves to the end-of-text.</li>
				<li>Find Dialog.  Ctrl-F brings up the find dialog.  Enter or recall a pattern and then click on Find to
				 move back to the section of code with that pattern.</li>
				 <li>Repeat Search.  Plant a distinctive pattern in the vicinity of those regions you wish to visit.
				 Press F3 or Shift-F3 to repeat the search for the pattern until you arrive at the desired section of code.</li>
				<li>Goto Dialog. Press Ctrl-G and then enter the approximate line number for the section of code you
				wish to visit.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>9.2.10 When is it possible to undo a redo operation? Is it possible to redo an undo operation?</h3>
			First, a couple of points. You can only perform an undo operation after an insert or delete operation has been
			performed and you can only perform a redo operation after an undo has been performed Only the last N insert or
			delete operations can be undone, where N is set by the MaximumUndoDepth parameter. Operations must be undone in
			reverse order.
			After an undo operation is performed, it becomes a pending redo operation and after a redo operation the operation
			becomes a pending undo.  Finally, all pending redo operations are discarded after an insert or delete operation.<br>
			So, after a redo operation has been performed, it is possible to undo it for as long as it remains on the undo
			stack.<br>
			And, after an undo operation has been performed, it is possible to redo it as long as long as no intervening insert or
			delete operations are performed.

	    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><INPUT TYPE='button' VALUE='Top of Page' onClick='navigate("#TOP");'></P><P><H2><A NAME="S3"></A>9.3 Selected Text</H2></P>		
		    <div class="h2section" id="9.3 Selected Text">
			   <h3>9.3.1 How should I view selected text?</h3>
			View the process of selecting text and then performing an operation on that text as a single operation that
			requires an intermediate step.  After selecting text you can delete the selected text, copy it to the clip
			board, or do both (cut).  You can also indent, unindent, comment, or uncomment selected text.
			
			<h3>9.3.2 How can I select an entire agent with a single keystroke?</h3>
			If paren matching is enabled, and if a pair of brackets are matched, Ctrl-S will select the text between the
			brackets, or just use the mouse to move to the I-beam cursor to the opening (or closing) bracket and then rapidly
			press the left button twice to select the entire agent.
			
			<h3>9.3.3  Are there any operations that don't either delete or deselect the currently selected text?</h3>
			Yes, there are a few operations that do not deselect the currently selected text: copy, indent/unindent,
			comment/uncomment, set tabs and replace-all in a selection.
			
			<h3>9.3.4 How do I replace selected text with a tab character?</h3>
			Use Ctrl-I.  The tab key is usurped for indenting.
			
			<h3>9.3.5 What is the best way to select a large amount of text?</h3>
			Use Click to set the cursor at one end of the block of text to be selected  Then, move up or
			down to the end of the block of text to be selected.  Depress the shift key and then
			press the left mouse button to extend the selected text to the new position.
			
			<h3>9.3.6 How do I deselect currently selected text?</h3>
			Just move the cursor to a new position.  Do not hold down the shift key while moving the cursor.
			
			<h3>9.3.7 How do I extend the currently selected text?</h3>
			When first selecting text, an anchor is set at the starting position of the selected area.  If selecting text
			backwards, the anchor is at the end of the selected area; else, the anchor is at the front of the selected area.
			To extend the selected text past the anchor, use any of the move commands, including the mouse, while holding
			down the shift key.
			
			<h3>9.3.8 How can I fix the indenting of a chunk of source code copied from elsewhere?</h3>
			Sometimes imported source code does not conform to standard format.  Statement blocks may be indented
			using a mixture of spaces and tabs based upon a non-standard tab width.  Select a section of the text to be
			repaired and then press Ctrl-T to bring up the Set Tab Dialog.  You can use Detab to replace leading tabs in
			the selected rows with the equivalent number of spaces.  The tab width to be used while replacing the tabs
			may be set using the SpacesPerTab spin box.  A mixture of spaces and tabs can be replaced with just leading spaces.
			Also, you can use Tabify to replace leading spaces with the equivalent number of tabs.  The number in the
			SpacesPerTab box is used to determine the tabwidth of the inserted tabs.  The option selected in the ExtraSpaces
			group determines what to do with the left over spaces.  See section 3.5 on the TabSet Dialog for more details.

	    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><INPUT TYPE='button' VALUE='Top of Page' onClick='navigate("#TOP");'></P><P><H2><A NAME="S4"></A>9.4 Formatting</H2></P>		
		    <div class="h2section" id="9.4 Formatting">
			  <h3>9.4.1 When I move the cursor next to an opening bracket (,{,[,&lt; or next to a closing bracket &gt;,],},),
			The region between the brackets is not highlighted?</h3>
			There are several reasons for this.  Check the following items:
			<ol>
				<li>Paren matching disabled. Press Ctrl-( (Ctrl-9) or Ctrl-) (Ctrl-0) to enable paren matching.</li>
				<li>No matching bracket.  The number of opening brackets must match the number of closing brackets.  Thus,
				the first bracket will not be matched in &quot;X[ Y[ Z ]&quot; if the cursor is in front of the first brace.</li>
				<li>Cursor position.  The cursor position must be moved to the front of an opening bracket or just past
				a closing bracket to trigger the highlighting.</li>
				<li>Cursor not moved.  Highlighting may not be triggered by some insert or delete operations.  Move the cursor
				a short distance and then move it back.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>9.4.2 How can I represent underline, bold, or italicized characters?</h3>
			Currently, the only mechanism to highlight characters is to select a different text color or background color.
			The source code would have to be modified to represent tagged text with a different color.
			
			<h3>9.4.3 How do I center or right-justify a block of text?</h3>
			Currently, AisEd does not support center or right-justify.  You can approximate these effects using
			the indent/unindent commands. 
			
			<h3>9.4.4 How do I change the size of the font?</h3>
			The font size can be modified by changing the FontSize parameter in the configuration file. The font size
			is in units of &quot;points&quot; where 72 points is one inch.  Recommended point sizes
			are 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.
			
			<h3>9.4.5 How can I do double-sided printing?</h3>
			Currently, the text editor does not support double-sided unless the printer itself is capable of double-sided
			printing.
			
			<h3>9.4.6 How can I distinguish between tabs, spaces, and newlines?</h3>
			Tabs, spaces, and newlines are not normally visible.  Tabs and newlines can be made visible by setting
			ShowNewlines and ShowTabs to one in the configuration file or by pressing Ctrl-Insert.
			
			<h3>9.4.7 How can I check for extra tabs, spaces past the last visible character in a row?</h3>
			There are two ways to do this.  One way is to make tabs and newlines visible as noted in the above FAQ.
			Extra tabs and spaces can be identified as blank space between the last visible character and the newline character.
			A second way is to select a block of text.  Lines where the highlighting extends more than one character position past
			the last visible character have extra spaces or tabs on the end of the line.
			
			<h3>9.4.8 In the SetTab Dialog, how can I undo a conversion?</h3>
			If converting spaces to tabs using Tabify, be sure to select the Keep option.  To undo a conversion just select
			Detab with the same SpacesPerTab as used to Tabify.  If the Tab or Delete options are selected, the extra spaces
			cannot be restored.<br>
			If converting tabs to spaces using Detab, undo the conversion by clicking on Tabify with the same number of SpacesPerTab.

	    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><INPUT TYPE='button' VALUE='Top of Page' onClick='navigate("#TOP");'></P><P><H2><A NAME="S5"></A>9.5 Searching</H2></P>		
		    <div class="h2section" id="9.5 Searching">
			    <h3>9.5.1 How can I search just the current module?</h3>
			Double-click on the beginning paren or curly brace of a module to select the module.  Choose to search this
			selected region using the Select option in the Region button group.
			
			<h3>9.5.2 How can I repeat the last search from the top?</h3>
			F3 continues the search forward from the current cursor position.  To repeat a search from the top, press
			Ctrl-Home to move the cursor to the top of the text and then press F3.  Likewise, to search backwards from
			the bottom of the text, press Ctrl-End to move the cursor to the bottom of the text and then press Shift-F3.
			To search the entire text from the current cursor position, use Ctrl-F3.
			
			<h3>9.5.3 How can I reverse the direction of my last search?</h3>
			While using the Find or Replace dialog, select the Down option to search forward from the cursor.  Select Up
			to search backwards from the cursor.  While repeating the search, use F3 to search forward and use Shift-F3 to
			search backwards.  Unlike some other editors, F3 always searches forward and Shift-F3 always searches backward.
			
			<h3>9.5.4 How can I modify the pattern or check-box options while repeating the last search?</h3>
			Use Ctrl-F to bring up the search dialog.  Modify the settings and then press Return to perform at least one
			search. Select Close and continue searching using F3 or Shift-F3.
			
			<h3>9.5.5 How can I delete all occurences of a word?</h3>
			Use Ctrl-R to bring up the replace dialog.  Enter the word or phrase to be deleted in the Find text box.
			Leave the Replace text box empty and then select Replace All.
			
			<h3>9.5.6 How can I check the current search settings while repeating a search?</h3>
			Use Ctrl-F to bring up the Find dialog in order to view the current settings.  Press Close to dismiss the
			dialog.
			
			<h3>9.5.7 How can I search for words that may contain a period?</h3>
			Use [\w\.] to match a word character or a period.  Thus [\w\.]+  will match &quot;foo.txt&quot;.
			
			<h3>9.5.8 How can I match any character except a letter?</h3>
			Use [^A-Za-z] to match any character except a letter.  Thus [^A-Za-z]+ will match &quot;123= 120 + 3&quot;.
			
			<h3>9.5.9 How can I find a pattern with just a trailing word boundary? I want to match any word ending in xyz.</h3>
			Press Ctrl-F to bring up the Find dialog.  Don't check either the match-word check box.  Enter the pattern xyz\b and then
			press Return.  The pattern will match &quot;UVxyz=W&quot; but not &quot;UVxyzW&quot;.  Note that \b does not
			match a character; it matches a boundary.  For example, the pattern \bxyz matches &quot;xyz&quot;.  Since
			nothing precedes xyz in the text, xyz starts on a word boundary.  
			
			<h3>9.5.10 Why does the pattern $ move the cursor to the end of the line?</h3>
			The element $ matches the end-of-line boundary (it does not match any character). Either use \$ to match the
			dollar-sign or uncheck the RegularExp check box.
			
			<h3>9.5.11 How do I search for a pattern that spans more than one row?</h3>
			The pattern is applied to each row in turn.  If it fails, the next row is searched for a match.  To find a
			pattern that spans more than one row, devise a pattern that spans just one row at a time and then check the
			matches manually.
			
			<h3>9.5.12 How do I search for line that just contains the pattern P and nothing else?</h3>
			Use ^P$ where P is the pattern you wish to match.  For example, ^\d+$ will match the row 123 but not X123.
			
			<h3>9.5.13 Why doesn't the pattern X^Y match the text X^Y?</h3>
			The tilde is a special character (even in the middle of a pattern). Compose the pattern with a backslash in front
			of the tilde, X\^Y.
			
			<h3>9.5.14 Why doesn't the pattern X$Y match the text X$Y?</h3>
			The dollar-sign is a special character (even in the middle of a pattern).  Compose the pattern with a backslash
			in front of the dollar-sign, X\$Y.
			
			<h3>9.5.15 How can I replace four spaces with a tab?</h3>
			The replace text box interprets the escaped characters \a, \f, \n, \r, \t, \v, \0nnn as described in Section 3.1.4
			Elements above.  Press Ctrl-R to bring up the Replace dialog.  Enter four spaces in the Find
			text box, and enter \t in the replace box.  Every row must have a single newline on the end, so don't add or
			remove newlines from a row.  To replace leading spaces with a tab, see section 3.5 on the SetTab Dialog.
			
			<h3>9.5.16 What does turning off regular expressions buy me?</h3>
			Not much and the loss of pattern matching is significant.  If you uncheck the regular expression checkbox, the fourteen
			special characters described above are no longer special. That is, they just match themselves.  You can accomplish the
			same thing by prepending a backslash in front of a special character in a regular expression.  Thus, the regular
			expression &quot;foo\.txt&quot; is the same as &quot;foo.txt&quot; with regular expressions turned off.  The added
			power of regular expressions is well worth the small cost of inserting an occasional backslash.
