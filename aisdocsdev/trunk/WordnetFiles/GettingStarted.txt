Notes:
 1. This note may be replaced by a RefGuide document on RefGuide at some point in the future.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:
 1. Check out the entire _RefGuide project from StarTeam into a folder named refguide.

 2. If not already constructed, add the following subdirectories to refguide:
		Bin		- Holds the AisRefGuide.db repository
		wwwroot	- Holds the generated html documentation pages

 3. Rename CoreContent folder to CoreContentAll.  Add a new subdirectory named CoreContent.

 4. Copy the following files from CoreContentAll into CoreContent:
		AStartup.sl
		Page_Help_Menu.html
		Template_Document.html
		Template_Essay.html

 5. Copy the document file and the files that it depends upon from CoreContentAll to
    CoreContent.  For example, if modifying Document_Agent_Message_Protocol.html, copy this
    document and the following files that it depends upon from CoreContentAll into
    CoreContent:
		Document_Agent_Message_Protocol.html
		Essay_AMP_Messages.html
		Essay_Submitting_AMP_Messages.html

 6. Click on Astartup.sl in the refguide directory to start up AIS.
	Initialize RefGuide as follows:
		Open the Cabinets Tab in the session form.
		Right-click on the RefGuide cabinet. Select Import. Import Source/RefGuide.sl

7. Click on the CoreContent cabinet in the cabinets tab.  The contents of this cabinet will
	appear in the right hand text pane. Double-click on the document to be edited. Edit the
	document as needed.

 8. Return to the console tab and run RefGuide by entering "(aisRefGuide)" in the Console
    command text area.  This command will generate a set of HTML document files in wwwroot.
    Inspect to make sure that the HTML documents are generated properly.  You do not need to
    run "(aisRefGuide.exportEmbeddedOntology ...)" because you are not extracting any
    embedded documentation from a source file.  The process of extracting reference
    documentation from other files is not described here.

 9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 as needed.  Close up AIS.

10. Rename CoreContent to MyCoreContent and rename CoreContentAll to CoreContent.  Copy the
	modified files from MyCoreContent to CoreContent. Restart AIS and run (aisRefGuide)
    again. This will take a while.  Fix any errors.

11. Copy the files from wwwroot into your ais/docs/onlinedocs directory.  Your online
    documents are now updated!

Converting HTML into Document and Essay Objects:

1. Find the  HTML Document to be converted. 
The list of AIS Documents are found in the Slider of the AIS Home Page in the old OnlineDocs
folder.  Their corresponding HTML Document is found in the ais Folder under the OnlineDocs
(old) subfolder.  Usually, the HTML Document Title is in the format  Title_src.htm.

2. Convert the HTML Document into a Document as shown in step 3 and Essay Ontology Object as
shown in step 5.

3. To make a Document Ontology Object, go to the root of the _refGuide folder. Open the file
DocOntology_Template.html. This is the template for your Document Ontology Object.

The Document  Ontology Template is divided into KnowledgeBase and the list of Essays.  The
KnowledgeBase division is composed of the Document Title, Topic, Subtopic and a list of
Keywords.  These keywords (termed as HumanKeywords) are used for searching purposes. The list
of Essays is composed of topical subdivisions of  the document.

4.  Fill in the Document Ontology Template with its corresponding values from the HTML
Document.
a. Fill in the KnoweldgeBase tags.
The Title in the Slider is the Document Title.  The Titles in the Sliders are  grouped under
different headings.  These Headings are the DocumentTopic.   Just fill in the appropriate
SubTopic and  HumanKeywords tags. 

b. Fill in the Essay List
In the HTML Document under each <div> tags  are <h1> headers tags.  The <h1> Headersin the
HTML Document will serve as the Essay Titles for the Essay tags.

Object, go to the root of the _refGuide folder. Open the file EssayOntology_Template.html.
This is thetemplate for your Essay Ontology Object.
