<h1>1 Analytic Information Server Users' Guide</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
The Analytic Information Server (AIS) provides access to the Analytic Information Server engine.  Besides executing
and storing Smart Lisp Lambdas and their data, the AIS includes a Development Environment that
allows users to compose, debug, save and restore Smart Lisp Lambdas.  The AIS may reside on
the user's machine, or on a separate machine that is located within a Local Area Network (LAN)
or on a remote machine that is connected to the Internet.
<p>
The AIS Users' Guide describes the AIS User Interface.  After a preliminary discusssion of several important
concepts in this section, the development environment portion of the interface (see Section 3 Session Form below),
and the management module (see Section 4 Management Module below).  The Lambda Message Protocol (AMP)
is described in a separate document named Lambda Message Protocol . AMP is an API (Applications Programming
Interface) that TCP/IP (Transport Internet Protocol/Internet Protocol) client applications can use to execute
Lambdas that reside in AIS.
The document includes a description of the built-in commands available to AIS client applications.
The built-in commands available to AIS developers is found a third document named the AIS Developers' Guide.
This Developers' Guide describes the built-in Lambdas that may be accessed from a SmartLisp program.</p>
<p>
Users may access the AIS in any of several ways.  A browser can access the AIS via an HTTP
(HyperText Transfer Protocol) connection.  A Macromedia Flash Player can access the AIS via an
XML socket layer.  Or a remote client application, such as the Development Environment, can
access the AIS via a bidirectional internet TCP (Transfer Control Protocol) socket connection.</p>
<p>
In addition to the Development Environment, an AIS Management Module is available to monitor and
to manage the operation of one or more AISs.  The Management Module can be dynamically configured
to allow a user to monitor a variety of AIS activities as noted below.</p>
<p>
Several concepts are essential to the understanding of the AIS architecture.  They are context, session,
and user.</p>
<h4>Context</h4>
A &quot;Context&quot; is an instance of an application running on the AIS.  A single AIS may have
one or more Contexts in execution at the same time.  A Context has the following properties:
<ul type=square>
	<li>Context Name.  Each context has a unique name.  Every AIS has a default Context that
	is automatically selected if the a context is not specified during the initialization of
	a new connection to an AIS.</li>
	<li>Working Directory. A directory on the server machine is associated with an application.
	The working directory may contain a Lisp statup file, subdirectories, log files and
	data, such as web pages, associated with the application.</li>
	<li>Startup File. A startup file initializes and configures the context.  Typical tasks are
	setting the memory size, selecting an alternate working directory, loading the browsLambda, 
	and initializing the dataMine Lambda.</li>
	<li>Memory Space.  Each Context runs with a separate memory space.  Two contexts may run
	the same application (or different applications) without interference.</li>
	<li>Configuration.  Each Context may be configured differently.  A Context may have a configuration
	file named abase.ini that contains configuration parameters and their values.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Session</h4>
A &quot;Session&quot; is one connection to a Context.  Typically, a user opens a Session to
execute in a Context that runs the application of interest.  A Context may have zero or more sessions
attached to it at the same time. However, only one session can be executing at any one time.  This
feature allows a programmer to write programs without concern for mutual exclusion when accessing
shared variables in a Context.  A Session may be established over an extended period. An
open session is not closed until the the user closes the Session, the Context is closed or until
a timeout expires (typically five days). The user may break the connection to a server and then
reattach to an existing session, even from a different computer.   All the concurrent Sessions in
a Context share the same memory space. A Session has the following properties:
<ul type=square>
	<li>Session ID.  Every open session has a identification number between 0 and N-1 where N is the
	number of open sessions on any Context.</li>
	<LI
	<li>Request Queue. Requests may arrive at the AIS over a connection to the AIS.  If the
	request can be satisfied &quot;immediately&quot;, a value is returned to the user.  However,
	if the request requires the engine to perform a task, a request is added to a request
	queue for this session.  The request is removed from queue when the response is returned
	from the engine.  Every request has a unique identification number.  The RequestID is an
	ever increasing integer starting from 1.</li>
	<li>User Logon ID. A user must logon (some applications may log the user on automatically)
	before the user can establish a session.  A user logs on with a security level from 0 to seven
	with seven being the highest level of security.  Every time a user logs on, a unique logon
	identification number is assigned to the logon.  This logon ID is an ever increasing integer
	for each AIS.</li>
	
</ul>
<h4>User</h4>
A permanent list of all authorized &quot;Users&quot; is maintained for all AISs.  Each entry
in the list contains the following information:
<ul type=square>
	<li>User ID.  Unlike the LogonID, this value never changes.  The ID 0 is assigned to
	the user &quot;Nobody&quot;.  Nobody has the security level of 0.  The ID 1 is assigned to
	the user &quot;Guest&quot;.  A Guest has a security level of 1 and does not have a password.</li>
	<li>User Name. A short user name is associated with each entry.  It is typically the first
	initial of the user's name followed by the user's last name. all lower case.</li>
	<li>Password.  An encrypted password is maintained for every user which is used to
	authenticate the user during the logon process.</li>
	<li>Security Level.  A security level is associated with each user.  This level varies from
	zero (lowest) to seven (highest).  Each protected AIS resource has a minimum required access
	level.  Users must have a security level at or higher than the resource's access level in order
	to access the resource.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.0 Navigation</h2>
<h3>1.0.0 Mouse</h3>
Some important terms are used throughout this document to describe common mouse operations.
The mouse, or other pointing device, allows the user to control the position of a &quot;cursor
&quot; on the display.  The following discussion assumes that your pointing device has at least two buttons.
For right-handed users, the left button is referred to as the &quot;standard&quot;
button and the right button is referred to as the &quot;alternate&quot; button and vice versa for left-handed users.
<p><b>Click.</b>
Click refers to positioning the cursor over a &quot;widget&quot; (see section 1.0.1 below), and
quickly pressing and then releasing the standard button without moving the cursor.
</p>
<p><b>RtClick.</b>
RtClick refers to peforming a Click using the alternate button.
</p>
<p><b>Double-click.</b>
A double-click refers to performing a standard Click two times in rapid succession without
moving the cursor.</p>
<p><b>Select.</b>
A portion of text can be selected by pressing the standard button and then dragging the cursor
in any direction over the text to be selected while continuing to press the standard button.
Typically, the selected text is shown
in a distinctive color with a dark blue or grey background.  When using the Smart Lisp text
editor, blocks of related text may be highlighted in a light green color.  This type of
highlighting should not be confused
with selected text.  Sometimes the word Select is used in place of Click when refering to
a button.  We avoid this use of the word Select (although we may slip up sometimes).</p>

<h3>1.0.1 Keyboard Focus</h3>
Some boxes on the display can process a key press. Most notably, all boxes that allow text
input can accept a key press. But only one of all various widgets will receive a key press.
(This is not quite true, but it is close enough for this discussion). The box that has the
&quot;keyboard focus&quot; is the one that receives the key press. Typically, a blinking
vertical bar indicates that a particular box has the keyboard focus.
<p>
The keyboard focus is moved to a box by Clicking (see Click above) anywhere inside the box.</p>
<p>
<em>Some mouse operations and some keyboard presses will not work until a box gets
keyboard focus.  Specifically, a context menu or dialog depends upon which, if any, box has
focus. You were warned.</em></p>

<h3>1.0.2 Hot Keys</h3>
Hot keys refer to a key or a combination of keys that quickly perform common operations.
It is very important to keep these hot keys in mind to take advantage of the features
provided by AIS.
Not all hot keys are enabled at all times.  The scope of the key function is noted for
each hot key described in this document.
A few hot keys are mentioned here.  More are described in section 2.1 below.
<p>
Ctrl-X refers to pressing the Ctrl key first, then pressing the X key while
continuing to hold down the Ctrl key. The same comments apply to Alt-X and Shift-X.
<p>
The &quot;Return&quot; key is the large key on
the right side of the keyboard. It is sometimes labeled Enter&lt;-- rather than Return.</p> 
<p><b>Ctrl-Tab.</b>
While two or more forms are maximized in the AIS window, Ctrl-Tab quickly switches from one
form to the previously displayed form.  Use this hot key to quickly switch between forms.</p>

<p><b>Ctrl-Return.</b>
Ctrl-Return is effective when editing in either of the Console text boxes and in the Tables
filter text edit pane.  Use this hot key to run a command rather than moving the cursor to
the next line.</p>

<p><b>Ctrl-Bar.</b>
Ctrl-Bar is effective when editing in either of the Console text boxes.  Use this hot key
to insert a DEL character into a command line.  The Delete key deletes the character to
the right of the keyboard cursor.</p>

<p><b>Esc.</b>
Esc is effective when running a program.  Use this key to stop execution of a runaway program.
</p>

<h3>1.0.3 Selected text</h3>
Text in a text edit pane can be selected as noted in 1.0.0 above.  If some text is selected
and a normal key is pressed, the selected text is <em>replaced</em> by the key press.
<p>Many hot keys, menu options, and toolbar buttons require text to be selected beforehand.
Select some text before using cut, delete, find/replace, indent, and comment operations.</p>

<h3>1.0.4 Fly-over help</h3>
The little picture on toolbar buttons is referred to as an &quot;icon&quot;. 
Standard icons that are familiar to most Windows users are employed whenever possible.  Nevertheless,
the function associated with some icons may not be obvious to the user.  If the cursor is
held over a toolbar button for a second or more, a short description explaining the button's function
appears until the cursor is moved away from the icon.

<h2>1.1 Widgets</h2>
The folks at Xerox Design Center are the original developers of the modern Graphical User Interface
(GUI).  They adopted the word &quot;widget&quot; as a generic term to refer to any of the items
that appear in the interface.  Over the years, the definition of many of these widgets has become
muddled.  The desecription of the most important widgets referred to in this document are defined in
this section.
<h3>1.1.0 Window</h3>
A window is the outermost container widget that holds all the other widgets.  A window
It consists of a title bar, an optional menu, an optional tool bar, and a status bar at the bottom.
A window can be resized, maximized, moved to the task bar at the bottom of the display, or covered
up by another menu. 
The main AIS window consists of a title bar, a basic menu at the top, one or more forms in the center,
and a status bar at the bottom.  Each of these widgets are described in more detail below.
The user can grab (hold down the standard key) an edge of the window and move the cursor to
resize the window.  The forms inside the main window can be maximized, tiled, or cascaded.

<h3>1.1.1 Forms</h3>
A form is a container widget with a menu at the top that fits inside the GUI window. When the form
is maximized, the form menu is merged with the Window menu.  The form's title is appended to the
window title in the title bar at the top.
 
<h3>1.1.2 Tabs</h3>
A form may contain yet another container widget called a tab.  A tab container is distinguished
by a tab-like label at the top of the container.  As additional tab widgets are opened the
labels are arranged across the top of the set of tabs.  A hidden tab container may be brought
to the front by clicking on its tab label.

<h3>1.1.3 Dialog</h3>
A dialog is a separate window that pops up to provide a warning or to gather information required
to carry out an operation.  Dialogs can be either modal or non-modal.  A modal dialog disables
all other windows.  The user must respond to the dialog and then close it prior to interacting
with any other window.  A non-modal dialog does not disable the other windows.  As an example,
the Replace dialog is modal.  One may find and/or replace one or more instances of a phrase in
a text window, but the text cannot otherwise be modified until the replace dialog is closed.
The Find dialog is non-modal.  One can modify the text or move the cursor in an text window without
closing the Find dialog.

<h3>1.1.4 Context Menu</h3>
Many widgets have a hidden menu, called a context menu, that is made visible by a Rt-Click on the
widget.  These context menus provide an alternate way to launch operations rather than using
just the menu at the top of the window.

<h3>1.1.5 Menus</h3>
The items in a menu are revealed by Clicking on the menu.  Some menu items have a small right
arrow on the right.  By Clicking on this arrow, yet another submenu appears.  Specific menus
are described in the sections below.
<p><b>Disabled items.</b>
At times a menu item or a button is disabled.  When a menu item is disabled, it appears as
a pale grey version of its normal appearance.  For example, most menu items are disabled
whie the engine is busy.  On the other hand, the stop menu item is only enabled while the
engine is busy.  The circumstances under which a menu item is disabled is defined below.</p>

<h3>1.1.6 EditView/ LineEdit</h3>
An EditView widget or an LineEdit widget allows the user to enter one or more lines of text.  The
edit view for editing Smart Lisp code includes syntax highlighting as noted below. An EditView
widget may also be used for displaying output.  For example, the AIS Management Form uses
an EditView to display multiple lines of text.

<h3>1.1.7 ListView</h3>
A ListView widget displays a list of items.  The list view can consist of one or more columns.
An entry in a column may contain an icon and/or text. The column may also be organized as 
a tree view.

<h3>1.1.8 DropDownCombo</h3>
A DropDownCombo widget combines a LineEdit with a drop-down list.  For example users may enter
a new command or select an old command from the drop-down list.  A DropDownCombo is used
for entering commands in the Console Tab as noted below.

<h3>1.1.9 Button</h3>
A toolbar Button widget is a button that displays an icon.  An icon allows a very compact set
of buttons that provide quick access to commonly used menu items.  They may also provide a visible
alternative to hot keys.  By holding the cursor over a toolbar button, a brief description of
the icon's function appears.

<h3>1.1.10 Toolbar</h3>
A toolbar is a container widget that holds one or more toolbar buttons.  Toolbars play an
important role in the Debugger Tab and in the Editor Tab.

<h3>1.1.11 Grid</h3>
The Tables Tab has a Grid to display the rows and columns of a table.  The current implementation
of a Grid is implemented so that only those cells that are visible are fetched from the server.
Large tables can be displayed quickly without waiting to retrieve the entire table.  It also
has the side benefit of reducing the load on the AIS since only a portion of the table is fetched.

<h3>1.1.12 TitleBar</h3>
The TitleBar at the top of a window has several important functions.  Primarily it describes
the application.  In this case, the Analytic Information Server.  Additional information about the
currently selected form is added to the title page.  A title with a light background indicates
that the window is not currently activated.  By clicking on the window, the title background
turns dark, indicating that the window has gained the focus.

<h3>1.1.13 StatusBar</h3>
The StatusBar at the bottom of the window displays important messages on the left.  The
Lisp editor shows the text cursor's position on the right. 
<p><b>EngineBusy.</b>
The EngineBusy icon on the right side of the status bar turns red when the engine is
busy.  Most menu items, buttons, and hot keys are disabled while the engine is busy.</p>
