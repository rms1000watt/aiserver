Analytic Information System Service/Daemon

Chapter 1. Overview
    This document explains the procedures for installing and configuring the
    AIS Service/Daemon in both Windows and Linux environments.

Chapter 2. Windows Environment
    This chapter explains the setup of AIS Service under Windows.

2.1 Installation
    The syntax for installing AIS Service is as follows:
        aissvc.exe --install [service name] [display name] [startup script]
            or
        aissvc.exe --install-manual [service name] [display name] [startup script]

    Using --install would set the startup type of the service to automatic.
    Which means, the service will automatically started at boot time.

    Using --install-manual would set the startup type of the service to manual.
    The service can be started using the Service Control Manager or
    the --start command, see Section 2.1.

    The [service name] parameter specifies the unique identifier of the service.
    The same value is used when removing, starting, or stopping a service.

    This parameter allows several instances of the AIS Service to be installed
    in the system. Which can be useful when dealing with multiple configurations.

    When installing serveral instance of the AIS Service, it is necessary to have
    different copies of the AIS Service binary and the required configuration files.

    The contents of the configuration files should not be conflicting with each
    other as well.

    The [display name] parameter corresponds to the displayed name in the
    Service Control Manager list. It does not have to be unique. But this can
    be useful to easily identify between different configurations.

    The [startup script] parameter specifies the full path to the startup script
    which will be loaded by the AIS service at run-time.

    Important:  The full path to the startup script must be used.

    Examples:

    To install AIS Service (automatic)
    C:\ISC\AIS>aissvc.exe --install "AIS" "Analytic Information System" "C:\ISC\AIS\Test\AStartup.sl"

    To install AIS Service (manual)
    C:\ISC\AIS>aissvc.exe --install-manual "AIS" "Analytic Information System" "C:\ISC\AIS\Libraries\AStartup.sl"

    To install 2 AIS Service instances
    C:\ISC\AIS_1>aissvc.exe --install "AIS1" "Analytic Information System 1" "C:\ISC\AIS_1\Test\AStartup.sl"
    C:\ISC\AIS_2>aissvc.exe --install "AIS2" "Analytic Information System 2" "C:\ISC\AIS_2\Test\AStartup.sl"

2.2 Removal
    The syntax for removing an installed AIS Service is as follows:
        aissvc.exe --remove [service name]

    The [service name] parameter specifies which installed service is to be removed.
    Note that if the service is still running, it will be stopped first, before getting removed from
    the Service Control Manager list.

    Warning: This feature is primarily designed to be used with AIS Service instance ONLY,
    but it can be used to remove other installed services. However this is NOT recommended.
    For it may cause major problems to the system if the wrong [service name] was used.

    Example:
    
    To remove an AIS Service:
    C:\ISC\AIS>aissvc.exe --remove "AIS1"

2.3 Starting
    The syntax for starting an installed AIS Service is as follows:
        aissvc.exe --start [service name]

    The [service name] parameter specifies which installed service is to be started.

    Warning: This feature is primarily designed to be used with AIS Service instance ONLY,
    but it can be used to remove other installed services. However this is NOT recommended.
    For it may cause major problems to the system if the wrong [service name] was used.

    Example:

    To start an AIS Service:
    C:\ISC\AIS>aissvc.exe --start "AIS1"

2.4 Stopping
    The syntax for starting an installed AIS Service is as follows:
        aissvc.exe --stop [service name]

    The [service name] parameter specifies which installed service is to be stopped.

    Warning: This feature is primarily designed to be used with AIS Service instance ONLY,
    but it can be used to remove other installed services. However this is NOT recommended.
    For it may cause major problems to the system if the wrong [service name] was used.

    Example:

    To stop an AIS Service:
    C:\ISC\AIS>aissvc.exe --stop "AIS1"

Chapter 3. Linux Environment
    This chapter explains the setup of AIS Daemon under Linux.

3.1 Installation
    The AIS installation/sources comes with a utility script called "aissvc.sh" which is
    designed to be modified and copied to "/etc/init.d or /etc/rc.d" directory of the Linux system.

    The first requirement for the setup is to copy all the required files to the target install directory,
    usually in "/usr/local/xxx". In this particular discussion we will use "/usr/local/ais".

    The following files/directories should be copied to the target install directory (e.g. /usr/local/ais):

    * AIS daemon binary (aissvcdevexe or aissvcdebugexe)
    * Libraries folder and contents (Libraries)
    * Configuration files (*.ini)
    * Usr folder and contents (usr)
    * Log folder (logs)
    * MySQL messages folder and contents (mysqlmsgs)
    * Test folders and contents (Test or TestAis)


    The AIS daemon can be configured to run as another user, typically with lesser
    privileges than the root user. If this is to be the case, the target user MUST 
    have read and write permissions to the target install directory. This can be done
    by changing the owner of the target install directory (using chown).

    After the preliminary steps are completed. The utility script "aissvc.sh" can already be copied to
    "/etc/init.d or /etc/rc.d". Most Linux distributions require additional system commands to be
    executed to complete the installation of the daemon. The filename of "aissvc.sh" can be renamed
    to something else (e.g. "aissvc").

    For Redhat-based distributions, the "chkconfig" command can be used.
        # chkconfig --add aissvc

    For Debian-based distributions, the "update-rc.d" command can be used.
        # update-rc.d aissvc defaults

    The commands above will create the necessary symbolic links that will
    configure the system to start and stop the daemon automatically.

    Certain script parameters/variables are required to be updated with the correct values:

    * bindir - Should be set to the absolute path to the target install directory (e.g. /usr/local/ais)
    * aissvc - Should be set to the name of the binary to be used (e.g. aissvcdevexe)
    * user - Should be set to the target effective user
    * pidfile - Should be set to the path of the desired PID file (optional)


3.2 Removal
    For Redhat-based distributions, the "chkconfig" command can be used.
        # chkconfig --del aissvc

    For Debian-based distributions, the "update-rc.d" command can be used.
        # update-rc.d aissvc remove

    The actual utility script will not be removed by the commands above.

3.3 Starting
    The following command can be used to start the AIS daemon.
        # /etc/init.d/aissvc start

3.4 Stopping
    The following command can be used to stop the AIS daemon.
        # /etc/init.d/aissvc stop
