OVERVIEW
A few notes on constructing this project follow.  Please make additions and corrections
as you work on this project.

ENVIRONMENT
Visual Studio 2008. Install Visual Studio 2008 on a machine running Windows XP Professional.  Note
that Visual Studio 2008 and later includes Visual Studio Tools for Office.  It makes it possible to
create an Excel 2003 add-in without any additional packages.

Excel 2003.  Install Excel 2003 on this same OS.  Some of our customers are still running Excel 2003
rather than Excel 2007 or later.  Excel 2007 is supposed to be backward compatible with Excel 2003, so
we may be able to run this code in either version of Excel.

CREATE EXCEL ADD-IN
To create a C# Excel add-in in a blank Visual Studio 2008:
	Select File -> New -> Project -> Visual C# -> Office -> Excel 2003 Add-in
		Name: AisExcel2003  (uncheck "Create directory for solution")

NEXT STEPS
 1. Create a dialog that will connect to a running version of an AIS server (either webide or aissvc).
The user will enter server IP address (or maybe local if a local server???).

ADD EXCEL DIALOG
To add a dialog, select:
	Project -> Add Windows Form. Name: AisExcel.
	In AisExcel.cs [designer], drag two buttons onto the form.
		Names: uOkButton, uCancelButton. Text: OK, Cancel
	In the AisExcel Form, set the following properties:
		Form Border Style: Fixed Dialog
		Minimize Box:	False
		Maximize Box:	False
		Accept Button: 	uOkButton
		Cancel Button:	uCancelButton
Double click on the OkButton on the form to install the click handler. Add code to capture
results from dialog. No need to call close as the form does that for you.
Double click on the CancelButton on the form to install the click handler. No need to call close
as the form does that for you.
Just add MyCancel.showDialog() to the code to bring up an instance of this modal dialog.

If you change the name of a form or a widget on the form, the code is only partially updated.
It is best to avoid renaming widgets or forms.

ADD ASOCKET CLASS
To add a class, rt-click on AisExcelClinet in the Solution Explorer.  Select Add -> New Item -> Class.
Set the class template name to ASocket.cs. This adds ASocket.cs file and entry to the solution
explorer.
