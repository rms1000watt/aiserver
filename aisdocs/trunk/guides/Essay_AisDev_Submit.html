		    <div class="h2section" id="Submitting AMP Messages">
			<p>Every application, regardless of the protocol used, submits requests to AIS using AMP
			and only AMP.  Provided that the user has sufficient authorization, both built-in (_ais)
			and application-specific messages may be submitted.  Before launching into a detailed
			discussion of each protocol, a few examples are shown in this section.</p>
			<p>
			Important Note!  Except for the domain name, AMP message names are case-sensitive.  Param1
			will not be recognized if param1 is expected.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Assumptions.</b>  In the discussion below, a representative built-in message of the
			form:<br>
			 _ais<b>[]</b>noop<b>[]</b>arg0<b>[]</b>hello<br>
			 and a sample application-specific message of the form:<br>
			 testAgent<b>[]</b>ampAct<b>[]</b>param1<b>[]</b>Some value<br>
			are included in the examples.  These sample AMP messages can be replaced by any valid AMP
			message supported by the application.  Also, the domain name, www.byagent.com can be
			replaced by the specific Agent Information Server that you are using; however, amp.dll
			should not be modified.</p>
			
			<h3> HTTP HyperText Transfer Protocol</h3>
			The HTTP is utilized by several types of clients.  Some examples:
			<ul>
				<li>Browser, such as Internet Explorer 5.5 or above</li>
				<li>Client-side JavaScript embedded in a web page</li>
				<li>Macromedia Flash player using HTTP</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			<b>Examples.</b> A wide variety of formats are supported by the HTTP interface.  A
			URL-encoded query string may be appended to the URL, a URL-encoded string may be
			included in the body of a POST request, or an XML document may be included in the
			body of a POST request.</p>
			
			<b>Query String Examples:</b>
			<ul>
			http://www.byagent.com/amp.dll?_ais=noop&amp;arg0=hello<br>
			http://www.byagent.com/amp.dll?testAgent=ampAct&amp;param1=Some&nbsp;Value
			</ul>
			<p>
			<b>POST body (from a form or javascript) Examples:</b></p>
			<ul>
				_ais=noop&amp;arg0=hello
				testAgent=ampAct&amp;param1=Some Value
			</ul>
			<b>XML POST (Flash player using HTTP) Examples</b>:
			<ul>
				&lt;amp target&quot;_ais&quot; act=&quot;noop&quot;/&gt;<br>
				&lt;amp target&quot;targetAgent&quot; act=&quot;ampAct&quot;&gt;&lt;param1&gt;Some Value
				&lt;/param1&gt;&lt;/amp&gt;
			</ul>
			
			<h3> XML Socket Protocol</h3><p>
			Unlike HTTP, all requests use a single format, XML (eXtensible Markup Language).  The XML
			socket is utilized by several clients.  Also unlike HTTP, this protocol just sends a
			XML document terminated by a null or ctrl-A.  Some example clients using this protocol:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Macromedia Flash player connecting to an XML socket.</li>
				<li>JavaScript with embedded ActiveXControl that supports a socket connection.</li>
			</ul>
			<b>Sample XML Documents:</b>
			<ul>
				&lt;amp target=&quot;_ais&quot; act=&quot;noop&quot;&gt;&lt;arg0&gt;Hello&lt;
				/arg0&gt;&lt;/amp&gt;<br>
				&lt;amp target=&quot;targetAgent&quot; act=&quot;ampAct&quot;&gt;&lt;param1&gt;
				Some Value&lt;/param1&gt;&lt;/amp&gt;<br>
			</ul>
			
			<h3> APP Protocol</h3><p>
			Requests to the engine can be submitted from the console-edit combo box at the top of the
			Console tab.  A DEL character may be entered into the command-line by pressing Ctrl-|.
			Under the covers, SmartLisp expressions are converted into AMP messages.  Also, an
			application-specific AMP request start with a percent sign.  The request is converted into
			an AMP message.   In either case the AMP message is processed in the same way as for any
			other protocol server.</p>
			<b>Sample APP Requests (entered on the console-edit line)</b>
			<ul>
			SmartLisp Expression:<br>
				(setq x {hello})<br>
			Built-in AMP message:<br>
				_ais<b>[]</b>noop<b>[]</b>arg0<b>[]</b>Hello<br>
			Application-specific AMP message:<br>
				%testAgent<b>[]</b>ampAct<b>[]</b>param1<b>[]</b>Some Value<br>
			</ul>
			<p>
			Be sure to use a DEL character as a separator. It appears as a <em>dark</em> vertical bar
			in the console's command-line window.  Also, keep in mind that case matters.</p>

	    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><INPUT TYPE='button' VALUE='Top of Page' onClick='navigate("#TOP");'></P><P><H2><A NAME="S2"></A>HTTP Server</H2></P>		
		    <div class="h2section" id="HTTP Server">
			<p>An HTTP client may send AMP messages to AIS using the HTTP GET method. For instance,
			using a web browser, specify a URL in which the &quot;file&quote; is amp.dll with
			a query string appended.  The AMP message is URL-encoded in the query portion of the
			request.  Notice that the target agent and the speech act must be placed at the front
			of the query string.</p> 
			
			<b>Example:</b>
			<ul>
			<b>General Form:</b> http://www.byagent.com/amp.dll?testAgent=ampAct&amp;amp;param1=value1<br>
			<b>Built-in:</b> http://www.byagent.com/amp.dll?_ais=login&amp;amp;username=tmay&amp;amp;
			password=&amp;lt;!@&amp;gt;-/
			</ul>
			<p>
			<b>HTTP POST Example.</b> On a web page, use a form similar the following HTML form
			to send an HTTP POST request to AIS:</p>
			<ul>
			&lt;FORM action=&quot;/amp.dll&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;<br>
			&lt;INPUT type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;testAgent&quot; value=&quot;ampAct&quot;&gt;<br>
			&lt;INPUT type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;param1&quot;&gt;<br>
			&lt;INPUT type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot;&gt;<br>
			&lt;/FORM&gt;
			</ul>
			
			<h3> HTTP Encoding</h3><p>
			AMP Messages sent to AIS using the HTTP protocol is URL-encoded (except a POST body
			using XML). AIS will URL-decode the incoming query string or POST body and convert the
			result into a DEL-delimited AMP message into a form appropriate for submission
			to the specified target agent. Encoding is typically performed automatically by the
			browser or other HTTP client.</p>
			
			<h3> HTTP Limitations</h3><p>
			HTTP has severe limitations as an application protocol. Keep the following aspects of HTTP
			in mind when using HTTP to talk to AIS:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>HTTP is a request/response protocol. This means that the client must make a
				 request and then wait for a response from AIS. There must always be one and only one
				 response to each client HTTP request.  Although multiple requests may be submitted,
				 no request is processed until a response to the previous request from that web
				 client is received (or cancelled by the user). A server can never initiate a message
				 to a HTTP client.</li>
				<li>HTTP clients must support cookies for AIS to keep track of important client
				connection information.</li>
			</ul>	    
		  </div>
	    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><INPUT TYPE='button' VALUE='Top of Page' onClick='navigate("#TOP");'></P><P><H2><A NAME="S3"></A>XML Socket Server</H2></P>		
		    <div class="h2section" id="XML Socket Server">
			<p>AIS supports an XML Socket server interface. This interface allows TCP/IP clients to
			establish a permanent connection and then exchange AMP messages packaged in an XML format.
			Unlike HTTP, the XML Socket interface is bi-directional and allows AIS to push AMP messages
			to the client at anytime. XML Socket clients must be event-driven to take full advantage
			of the AIS XML server.  The XML client is not required to suspend operation and wait for
			an immediate return to a request.  Rather, all requests, even those that can be computed
			quickly by AIS, are treated as asynchronous calls by the XML client.  A typical XML request
			is of the form:</p>
			<ul>
			 &lt;amp xtype=&quot;msg&quot; target=&quot;_ais&quot; act=&quot;login&quot;&gt;<br>
			 &lt;username&gt;tmay&lt;/username&gt;<br>
			&lt;password&gt;!@&amp;gt;-/&lt;/password&gt;<br>
			&lt;/amp&gt;
			</ul>
			where the following attributes of the root element, amp, are required:
			<ul>
				<li>xtype - &quot;msg&quot;, &quot;return&quot;, &quot;error&quot;.  Indicates the type of document.  Xtype is
				 always &quot;msg&quot; for AMP requests.  This attribute is optional.</li>
				<li>target - target agent. The target agent is the name of a target agent supported by
				the application or _ais for built-in functions.</li>
				<li>act - speech act. Any child agent provided by the named target agent.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			The contents of the root element may include zero or more child elements that specify
			a set of name-value pairs appropriate for the speech act named.</p>
			
			<h3> XML Encoding</h3>
			<p>
			AMP Messages sent to AIS using the XML protocol must encoded according to XML specifications.
			There are five, and only five, special characters that should be encoded as specified
			by the XML standard.  All other HTML encodings are neither necessary nor desirable.
			The predefined entities are shown on the right  for the following symbols (shown on the
			left):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>&amp;   &amp;amp;</li>
				<li>&lt;   &amp;lt;</li>
				<li>&gt;   &amp;gt;</li>
				<li>'   &amp;apos;</li>
				<li>&quot;   &amp;quot;</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			The standard requires that these characters (except the less-than sign (&lt;)) embedded
			in the content of an XML doc be encoded as predefined entities.</p>		    
		  </div>
	    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><INPUT TYPE='button' VALUE='Top of Page' onClick='navigate("#TOP");'></P><P><H2><A NAME="S4"></A>APP Server</H2></P>		
		    <div class="h2section" id="APP Server">
			<p>A target agent can be called directly using an AMP message of the form:<br>
			targetAgent<b>[]</b> * <b>[]</b>paramName<b>[]</b>paramValue&#133;</p>
			<p>
			A speech act can be called directly using an AMP message of the form:<br>
			targetAgent<b>[]</b>speechAct<b>[]</b>paramName<b>[]</b>paramValue&#133;</p>
			<p>
			In the first case, the faces statement in the definition of the target agent determines
			the type of access that is allowed.  In the second case, the faces statement in the
			definition of the speech act determines the type of access.  In either case, the faces
			statement is of the form:</p> 
			<blockquote>
			<pRE class="code">
			(defun someAgent (arg)
			    faces: (
			        (public type)     ; the type of access as noted below
			        (security level)  ; level is a value from 0 to 7 (7 is highest)
			)
			...
			)
			</pre> 
			</blockquote>
			<p>
			Type is one of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Amp:</b>   arg is a message structure described above.  The agent is
				 expected to return a message structure.</li>
			
				<li><b>true</b>   arg represents zero or more parameters passed as the parameter
				 values in the incoming AMP message.  The target agent, speech act, and parameter
				 names are not passed to the agent.  The return value does not have to be a structure.
				 The return value is converted to a string and returned to the client.</li>
				<li><b>false</b>    access is denied.  The agent can only be invoked internally.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			If the security value is omitted, it is set to zero.  If the public value is omitted,
			it is set to false.  Note that the target agent can have no access, but its speech acts
			can be accessible or vice versa.  Typically, the target agent is called for performing
			the initialization of an agent.</p>

	    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><INPUT TYPE='button' VALUE='Top of Page' onClick='navigate("#TOP");'></P><P><H2><A NAME="S5"></A>AIS Return Messages</H2></P>		
		    <div class="h2section" id="AIS Return Messages">
			<p>AMP agents return a structure. This structure is called the AIS Return Message
			Structure or just the AIS Return Structure.  The AIS Return Structure is processed, by
			AIS, into an AIS Output Message or just Aisout.  Aisout is a DEL-delimited
			string returned directly to the APP client.   HTTP and XML protocols transform Aisout
			into the appropriate format as described below.</p>
			<p>
			The structure returned by an AMP agent will often contain the same elements that were
			contained in the structure passed to the AMP agent when it was first called. It is
			expected that the AMP agent may modify and/or add elements to the structure during
			its processing. Of particular interest to AIS is the element named &quot;_returntype&quot;.
			The value of this structure element instructs AIS on how to package the AIS return
			structure for return to the client application.</p>
			<p>
			The processing, performed by AIS, on the AIS Return Structure is driven by the value of
			the &quot;_returntype&quot; element. Valid _returntype values include:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>AMP Message Processing</li>
				<li>URL Message Processing</li>
				<li>File Message Processing</li>
				<li>Text Message Processing</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			If no _returntype element is provided by the AMP agent, AMP Message Processing will be
			performed.  Besides AMP requests, other requests, such as built-in requests, can be
			submitted which do not involve a _returntype.  In these cases, the returned response
			is described for each protocol below.</p>
			
			<h3> Return Message Structure Processing</h3>
			<p> 
			When AMP Messages are returned from an AMP agent, they are processed in two phases. The
			first phase handles all transformations required regardless of the type of client
			connection protocol in use.  The second phase is performed by the connection protocol
			server communicating with the client.  AIS currently supports HTTP and XML Sockets
			connection protocols as well as an APP in-process protocol.</p>
			<p>
			In the first processing phase, the following steps are taken:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The _returntype element is found and a note of the requested processing made.
				 AMP message processing is assumed if no _returntype element is found.</li>
				<li>The _error element is searched for and if it exists a note is made of the _error
				element value is returned separately.  This error message is logged using the system
				message log.</li>
				<li>Elements that begin with an underscore in the AIS Return Structure are not
				returned.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			In the second processing phase, the message is packaged according to the type of client
			communication protocol in use.</p>
			<p>
			<b>_error Elements</b><br>
			The _error element allows an AMP agent to record an error in the system log. The _error
			element is never returned to the client.   Include error messages intended for the client
			in application-defined elements of the AMP message.</p>
			
			<table  cellspacing=0 border=0 cellpadding=2>
				<tr valign=top><td><b>_returntyp</b></td>
					<td><b>Message Processing</b></td></tr>
				<tr valign=top><td>0 - AMP processing</td>
					<td>The AIS Return Structure is transformed into a DEL-separated list of
					name-value pairs with all private elements removed.  Private elements are those
					whose name begins with an underscore.  This string is referred to as the retmsg. The
					initiating targetAgent and speechAct are automatically prepended to the retmsg.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr valign=top><td>1 - URL processing</td>
					<td>The AIS Return Structure is searched for an element having the name _url. The
					client is sent a redirect message to the resource specified by the value of the
					_url element. The returned URL may contain a query string.  In this case, the AMP
					agent itself is responsible for URL encoding the value of the _url element.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr valign=top><td>2 - FILE processing</td>
					<td>The AIS Return Structure is searched for an element having the name _file.
					The value of the _file element is a file specification relative to the AIS root
					directory (a root directory in AIS is defined for each protocol ). The client is
					sent the contents of the named file.  Due to the caching performed by some web
					clients and proxies, redirection using a return type of &quot;1 - URL processing&quot;
					may be a safer option than returning the contents of a file. </td>
				</tr>
					<tr valign=top><td>3- TEXT</td>
					<td>The AIS Return Structure is searched for an element having the name _mimetext
					and an element having the name _enctype. The client is sent the contents of the
					_mimetext element encoded according to the encoding type specified by the value
					of _enctype. In general, a _enctype of &quot;text/html&quot; or &quot;text/plain&quot; should be used
					for returning text to the client.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
			Binary can be returned to the client by placing the binary in a local file in a
			subdirectory reserved for temporary files and then using the URL element to redirect
			the client to fetch the local file. Binary can also be returned using FILE processing.
			AIS will delete old temporary files from the temporary file directory from time-to-time.
			The file extension provides the web client with important information regarding the nature
			of the binary file.  For example, foo.bmp is interpreted by most HTTP clients as a
			bit-mapped image file.</p>
			<h4>Supported Enctypes</h4>
			<p>
			If the returntype is set to 3 (TEXT) the following enctypes are supported:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>text/plain</b> The _mimetext is returned to the client without any modification.</li>
				<li><b>text/html</b>  The _mimetext is returned to the client without any modification.
				The web client expects this text to conform to the HTML standard.</li>
				<li><b>application/x-ampmsg</b>   The _mimetext should be a url-encoded query string that
				consists of a set of name-value pairs.  Typically, the first pair should be the calling
				target agent and its speech act.  The query string is url-decoded and converted into
				an AMP message string.   HTTP processing and XML processing proceeds in the same
				fashion as for a retmsg as described below for return type 0.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Application/x-ampmsg Example</h4>
			<p>
			Suppose _returntype is set to 3, _enctype is set to application/x-ampmsg and _mimetext
			is set to:</p>
			<ul>
				someAgent=someSpeechAct&amp;name=Bill%20House&mp;zip=92866
			</ul>
			<p>
			Then, the query string is url-decoded and converted to an aisout message:</p>
			<ul>
				someAgent<b>[]</b>someSpeechAct<b>[]</b>name<b>[]</b>Bill House<b>[]</b>zip<b>[]</b>92866
			</ul>
			<p>
			This aisout message is further processed as noted below for each protocol as described
			below.</p>
			
			<h3> Returned AIS Messages</h3>
			<p>
			If the request is submitted to the engine for processing, the RequestID is returned to APP
			clients immediately (HTTP and XML clients do not get back a RequestID).  Later, the response
			to the client's request is returned.  In the case of a request from an APP server, the RequestID
			is prepended to the response.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Pushed Output. </b> Pushed output includes display output and other output
			(e.g. send-to-client).  The target agent and the speech act are not prepended to display
			output but they are prepended to other unsolicited output.</p>
			<p>
			<b>Buffered Output.</b>  Console output generated by writeln, display, etc is buffered
			at the server and then sent out after a timeout occurs or when the return result is sent
			back to the client.  Output buffering enhances the performance of the server considerably.</p>
			
			<h3> Returned XML Messages</h3>
			<p>
			AMP Return Message Structures are packaged and returned to XML Socket clients based upon the
			type of processing specified by the _returntype element in that structure. The following
			table enumerates the types of processing performed in phase two for XML message responses.</p>
			<p>
			The XML server includes four attributes to the root element of the returned XML document.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>xid</b> If an xid attribute with an integer value is supplied in the original
				request, the xid is returned unmodified in the response.</li>
				<li><b>xtype</b> The xtype is set to &quot;return&quot; to distinguish it from other
				message types.</li>
				<li><b>target</b> The target attribute is set to the original targetAgent that made
				the request.</li>
				<li><b>act</b> The act attribute is set to the speech act of the originating request.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Example</h4>
			Given a logon request as guest with an xid of 123, the returned XML document would be:
			<pre>
			&lt;amp xid=&quot;123&quot; xtype=&quot;return&quot; target=&quot;_ais&quot; act=&quot;logon&quot&gt;
			&lt;userid&gt;5&lt;/userid&gt;&lt;level&gt;1&lt;/level&gt;&lt;days&gt;512&lt;/days&gt;
			&lt;comment&gt;Guest logon&lt;/comment&gt;&lt;/amp&gt;
			</pre>
			<div class="h2section" id="SendToClient"><h2>2.6 SendToClient</h2></div>
			<p>
			AMP agents may send messages to selected clients using the sendToClient SmartLisp function.
			SendToClient takes two arguments. The first the sessionID of the client to whom the information
			should be sent. The second argument is a structure that will be converted to an Aisout message
			by AIS and then sent to the client associated with the specified sessionID.</p> 
			<p>
			Consider the following example:   
			<blockquote>
			<pRE class="code">
			(defun sendToClientAct(iMsgStruct)
				faces:((public Amp:))
				vars:(aResult aSessionId aMsg)
				;; Send a message
				(setq aSessionId iMsgStruct[_sessionid:])
				(setq aMsg #{
						testAgent: &quot;sendToClient&quot;})
			msg: &quot;Message from sendToClientAct&quot;
			})
				(sendToClient aSessionId aMsg)
				;; Set the result
				(setq aResult &quot;message was sent&quot;)
			
				;; Put the result into the returned structure.
				(setq iMsgStruct[_mimetext:] aResult)
				(setq iMsgStruct[_enctype:] &quot;text/plain&quot;)
				(setq iMsgStruct[_returntype:] 3)	; Return text to client
				;; Check result
				(writeln iMsgStruct)
				(return iMsgStruct)
			 )
			</pre>      
			</blockquote>
			Three returns will be made:
			<ul>
				<li>The structure aMsg returned by call to sendToClient</li>
				<li>Contents of writeln showing the internal AMP message structure (sent to Server
				 Status Window)</li>
				<li>Text returned by the AMP call (return type 3)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			An example of these three returns (shown here as DEL-delimited strings) is:</p>
			<ul>
			testAgent<b></b>sendToClientAct<b></b>msg<b></b>Message from sendToClientAct<br><br>
			#{testAgent: &quot;sendToClientAct&quot; _sessionid: 0 _userid: 1 _level: 7 _mimetext:
			&quot;message was sent&quot; _enctype: &quot;text/plain&quot; _returntype: 3}<br><br>
			testAgen<b></b>sendToClientAct<b></b>message was sent<br>
			</ul>
			<p>
			Http clients only receive the final return result (the last message) since HTTP requires
			one response per request.  XML clients receive the first and last messages formatted as XML
			documents.  App clients receive the messages as shown above where <b>[]</b> indicates a DEL
			character.</p>
			<p>
			For XML-oriented applications, the choice of the first element in the sendToClient return is
			returned as a pair of attributes in the root element.  The &quot;target&quot; attribute is set
			to the name of the first element.  The &quot;act&quot; attribute is set to the value of the
			first element.  This allows the client to process sendToclient messages with the same logic as
			for all other responses from AIS.  Typically, applications make the first element the name of a
			target agent with its value set to an associated speech act, but this choice is not required.</p>
