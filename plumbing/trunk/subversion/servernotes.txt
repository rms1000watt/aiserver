INSTALL
To install subversion as a service on a Windows server, open a web browser and go to www.open.collab.net/.
Under News & Events, select Download CollabNet Subversion 1.5.4. Download the Server and Client
for Windows, CollabNetSubversion-server-1.5.4-1.win32.exe.  Copy this file to your install folder on the
Windows server and run it to install.  Click the link on the opening screen to view the latest post-install
instructions (an example is shown below).
Select a path for the repository such as D:\svn_repository.  Just select svnsvc so that the repository runs
as a service.  

POST-INSTALL
1. In a command window, navigate to D:\svn_repository. Create a repository with the command:
	svnadmin create AisRepos
2. Edit AisRepos\conf\svnserve.conf.  Uncomment the line password-db = passwd
3.  Edit conf\passwd.  Add yourself as a user. For example:
	Ted = mypassword
4. In the command window, start the svn service:
	net start svnserve
