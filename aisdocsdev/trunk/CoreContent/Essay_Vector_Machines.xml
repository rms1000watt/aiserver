		    <p>There are numerous modern machine learning algorithms and techniques which rely primarily 
		     on number vectors. The most famous vector learning method is Gaussian least squares linear regression. 
		     Until modern times, Gaussian linear regression was the only rigorous vector-based modeling technique. 
		     More recently, non-linear regression techniques have surfaced based upon the Gram matrix. The most 
		     famous of these modern techniques is Support Vector Regression.</p>
