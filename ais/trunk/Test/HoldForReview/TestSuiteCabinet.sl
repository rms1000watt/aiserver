;; name:     Genebase
;; 
;; summary:  Create the structure which holds the standard Genebase.
;;           Genebases are used to hold genome objects of a general
;;           nature. Each Genebase object stores the geneology for,
;;           and acts as the control structure for a genetic algorithm.
;;           The Genebase stores the individual genomes in the current
;;           generation, records the best genome in each past generation, 
;;           and controls the rate of reproduction, mutation, and cross
;;           over.
;;            
;; fields:   name:                The name of the Genebase. The default name is:
;;                                "Genebase1".
;;           generation:          The current generation count.
;;           maxGenerations:      The maximum number of generations.
;;           populationSize:      The count of genomes in each generation.
;;           survival:            The survival probability.
;;           crossOver:           The genetic cross over probability.
;;           mutation:            The genetic mutation probability.
;;           birthProc:           The birth procedure which must manage the initial 
;;                                random creation of a genome from scratch. (i.e
;;                                this procedure maps #void into a random genome.
;;           crossOverProc:       The genetic cross over procedure which maps two
;;                                genomes into a random "child" genome.
;;           mutationProc:        The genetic mutation procedure which maps a single

;;           fitnessProc:         The fitness procedure which maps each genome into
;;                                an integer fitness measure between 0 and 10000
;;                                where (0 is poor and 10000 is perfect). The
;;                                fitnessProc determines which genomes die and which
;;                                genomes survive into the next generation.
;;                                an integer fitness measure between 0 and 10000 (higher is better).
;;           genomeToKeyProc:     The genome to key procedure which maps each genome

;;           in each of the primary extents (i.e. block 1 is assigned to extent 1
;;           block 2 is assigned to extent 2 using modular arithmetic). The schema
;;           and table blocks are given text keys as follows:
;;
;;                "_schema"	                The Primary Schema child repository.
;;                "_volumeLabel{extentIndex}"	The volume label for each primary extent.
;;                "tablename_{Positive Number}"	The table blocks are assigned sequential numbers.
;;                "tablename_{Negative Number}"	All temporary table blocks are assigned negative numbers.
;;
;;           The Primary Schema is housed in a child repository to
;;           allow faster schema access, and to provide a single locking
;;           point for the entire data mine. The schema is a simple 
;;           associative memory with data mine "object names" as its keys.
;;           Each data mine "object name" is associated with its 
;;           corresponding schema record. The schema record layouts are as follows:
;;
;;           table or view: bckBlockRoot        The retrieval key (root name only) for all backup blocks.
;;                          bckSchema           The table's backup schema (#void if no backup).
;;                          blockCount	        The table's current block count.
;;                          blockSize 	        The number of records per table block.
;;                          ckpBlockRoot        The retrieval key (root name only) for all checkpoint blocks.
;;                          ckpSchema           The table's directory of check point schema (empty if no check point).
;;                          colCount	        The number of columns in the table.
;;                          colVector	        The table's vector of column names.
;;                          myObjectName        The table's name (identical to its data mine object name).
;;                          myObjectType        The object's type (table or view).
;;                          myTableName         The name of the table for this view.
;;                          myTableDate         The last update date of the table for this view.
;;                          newBlockRoot        The retrieval key (root name only) for all new blocks.
;;                          recordCount	        The table's current total record count.
;;                          recordStructure	The table's record structure (an attributed vector).
;;                          rowOrderSW	        The view is sorted by row order (views only).
;;                          tmpBlockRoot        The retrieval key (root name only) for all temporary block.
;;                          validFields   	The table's valid fields and types (necessary for query building).
;;                          viewFilter   	The view's initial filter (necessary for view resynching).

;;  ***NOTES***:
;; 
;; The selection measurement specification is composed of a series of commands
;; each separated from the other by the semi-colon ; symbol. Some examples
;; might be:
;;
;;     "min,|12 Month Profit|"
;;
;;     "avg,(,|6 Month Profit|,-,|3 Month Profit|,)"
;;
;;     "set,X,|3 Month Profit|;set,Y,(,|6 Month Profit|,-,X,);avg,Y"
;;
;; Notice the semi-colon ; symbol which separates the various commands. Also
;; notice the comma , symbols which separate the command arguments one from
;; another within a command. Each command is composed of a number of arguments.
;; The number of arguments may vary and is dependent upon the command verb
;; which is the first argument in any command, and upon the number and depth
;; of nested parentheses within the expression.
;;
;; Seven command verbs are currently supported. They are as follows:
;;
;;            set  sum  avg  min  max  var  std
;;
;; The final (right most) command must be one of (sum avg min max var std). All
;; of the left most commands must be set commands. Obviously, the set command
;; is only present to allow assignment of temporary variables. Any multiple
;; command measurement can be reexpressed as a single command measurement without
;; temporary variables at the expense of deeply nested parentheses.
;;
;;
;; Each command verb has a distinct meaning and requires somewhat different
;; command arguments. Remember that each command generates code which operates
;; on a stock table by reducing the number of stocks in the table. This is
;; called screening. Commands are evaluated left to right so that the righmost
;; commands always reduces the stock table which results from the leftmost
;; command.
;;
;;
;; **EXAMPLES**
;;
;; For instance we might want to measure the standard deviation of annual profit
;; for a group of selected stocks.
;;
;;     "std,|12 Month Profit|"
;;
;; We might want to measure the worst case quarterly loss for a group of 
;; selected stocks.
;;
;;     "min,|3 Month Profit|"

;;  ***NOTES***:
;; 
;; The selection measurement specification is composed of a series of commands
;; each separated from the other by the semi-colon ; symbol. Some examples
;; might be:
;;
;;     "min,|12 Month Profit|"
;;
;;     "avg,(,|6 Month Profit|,-,|3 Month Profit|,)"
;;
;;     "set,X,|3 Month Profit|;set,Y,(,|6 Month Profit|,-,X,);avg,Y"
;;
;; Notice the semi-colon ; symbol which separates the various commands. Also
;; notice the comma , symbols which separate the command arguments one from
;; another within a command. Each command is composed of a number of arguments.
;; The number of arguments may vary and is dependent upon the command verb
;; which is the first argument in any command, and upon the number and depth
;; of nested parentheses within the expression.
;;
;; Seven command verbs are currently supported. They are as follows:
;;
;;            set  sum  avg  min  max  var  std
;;
;; The final (right most) command must be one of (sum avg min max var std). All
;; of the left most commands must be set commands. Obviously, the set command
;; is only present to allow assignment of temporary variables. Any multiple
;; command measurement can be reexpressed as a single command measurement without
;; temporary variables at the expense of deeply nested parentheses.
;;
;;
;; Each command verb has a distinct meaning and requires somewhat different
;; command arguments. Remember that each command generates code which operates
;; on a stock table by reducing the number of stocks in the table. This is
;; called screening. Commands are evaluated left to right so that the righmost
;; commands always reduces the stock table which results from the leftmost
;; command.
;;
;;
;; **EXAMPLES**
;;
;; For instance we might want to measure the standard deviation of annual profit
;; for a group of selected stocks.
;;
;;     "std,|12 Month Profit|"
;;
;; We might want to measure the worst case quarterly loss for a group of 
;; selected stocks.
;;
;;     "min,|3 Month Profit|"

;;  ***NOTES***:
;; 
;; This Lambda provides a rule based capability for transforming
;; an old list into a new list.
;;
;; This Lambda accepts and saves a set of transformation rules in
;; its internal rules dictionary. Each rule is entered, by the
;; programmer, in two parts -- an IF form followed by a THEN form.
;; An example might be:
;; 
;;     (rulesLib.assert '(x + y) '(addi x y))
;;
;; We may then apply the above rules against a list as follows: 
;;
;;     (rulesLib.apply '(x + y))   ==>  '(addi x y)
;;
;; This Lambda supports wild card variables to make rule definitions
;; more flexible for the programmer. An example of wild card rule
;; variables is as follows:
;;
;;     (rulesLib.assert '($X + $Y) '(addi $X $Y))
;;
;; We may then apply the above rules against a list as follows: 
;;
;;     (rulesLib.apply '(m + 10))   ==>  '(addi m 10)
;;
;; The rules and wild card variables operate on sub lists as well
;; as the whole list as follows: 
;;
;;     (rulesLib.apply '((m + 10) + 20))   ==>  '(addi (addi m 10) 20)
;;
;; This Lambda supports named lambda rule definitions which allow
;; more flexible actions to be taken by the programmer during the
;; recognition phase and also during the production phase. Some 
;; examples of named lambda rule definitions is as follows:
;;
;;     (rulesLib.assert $FOLD:(lambda(op x y) vars:(f) (setq f (getGlobalValue (symbol op))) (f x y)))
;;     (rulesLib.assert $NUM:(lambda(x) (if (isNumber x) x)))
;;     (rulesLib.assert $OP:(lambda(x) vars:((d #{+ addi - subi * muli / divi})) (if (isMember x d) d[x])))
;;     (rulesLib.assert '(<$X=$NUM> <$Y=$OP> <$Z=$NUM>) '(<$FOLD> $Y $X $Z))
;;     (rulesLib.assert '($X <$Y=$OP> $Z) '($Y $X $Z))
;;
;; We may then apply the above rules against a list as follows: 
;;
;;     (rulesLib.apply '(m + 10))   ==>  '(addi m 10)
;;     (rulesLib.apply '(5 + 10))   ==>  15
;;
;; Double quoting a right hand production rule causes the append
;; function to be applied to the result as follows:
;;
;;     (rulesLib.assert '($X + $Y) ''((+) $X $Y))
;;     (rulesLib.apply '((5 6 7) + (10 20)))   ==>  '(+ 5 6 7 10 20)
;;
;; This Lambda supports multiple rule definitions up to the limits
;; of available memory. Rules asserted first have precedence over 
;; rules asserted later as follows:
;;
;;     (rulesLib.assert $OP:(lambda(x) vars:((d #{+ addi - subi * muli / divi})) (if (isMemEqv x d) d[x])))
;;     (rulesLib.assert '($X <$Y=$OP> $Z) '($Y $X $Z))
;;     (rulesLib.assert '(addi $X $X) '(muli $X 2))
;;     (rulesLib.assert '(addi $X 0) '$X)
;;
;; We may then apply the multiple rules against a list as follows: 
;;
;;     (rulesLib.apply '(m + m))   ==>  '(addi m m)
;;
;; This Lambda supports multiple passes, during rule application,
;; as follows:
;;
;;     (setq rulesLib.singlePass false)
;;     (rulesLib.apply '(m + m))   ==>  '(muli m 2)
;;     (rulesLib.apply '(m + 0))   ==>  m
;;
;; This Lambda supports asterisk wild card rules anywhere within lists,
;; as follows:
;;
;;     (rulesLib.assert '(min ($X*)) '(<$FN> min $X))
;;     (rulesLib.assert '($X* min)   '(<$FN> min $X))
;;     (rulesLib.assert $FN:(lambda(fn x) (append (list fn) x)))
;;     (rulesLib.apply  '(min (2 3)))  ==>  '(min 2 3)
;;     (rulesLib.apply  '((2 3) min))  ==>  '(min 2 3)

;;**EXPORTKEY**:screenBuilderNotes
;;  ***NOTES***: screenBuilder
;;
;; The table screen specification is composed of a series of commands
;; each separated from the other by the semi-colon ; symbol. Some examples
;; would be:
;;
;;     "all Timeliness = 1;top Sales 3"
;;
;;     "all Timeliness < 3;top Sales 10%"
;;
;; Notice the semi-colon ; symbol which separates the two commands. Also
;; notice the whitespace which separate the command arguments one from
;; another within a command. Each command is composed of a number of arguments.
;; The number of arguments may vary and is dependent upon the command verb
;; which is the first argument in any command.
;;
;; Five command verbs are currently supported. They are as follows:
;;
;;            all  top  bottom  omit  criteria
;;
;; A special field validity test command to omit filter code for each field
;; (referenced in the following query) may be specified as follows:
;;
;;            check
;;
;; Each command verb has a distinct meaning and requires somewhat different
;; command arguments. Remember that each command generates code which operates
;; on a database table by reducing the number of rows in the table. This is
;; called screening. Commands are evaluated left to right so that the righmost
;; commands always reduces the database table which results from the leftmost
;; command.
;;
;; For instance we might want to screen of all rows with a financial rating
;; of A1 and whose yield is in the top third. The following commands perform
;; such a screen.
;;
;;     "all |Financial Rating| = {A1};top |Dividend PS| / Price 30%"
;;
;; **ALL**
;;
;; The "all" command finds all table rows for which the expression is true.
;; There must be at least three arguments and there may be N arguments.
;;
;;   Arguments:
;;
;;     value1      Must be a valid scalar expression.
;;     relational  Must be a relational operator: = <> <= >= < >
;;     valueN      Must be a valid scalar expression.
;;
;;   Example One:
;;
;;     "all |Financial Rating| = {A1}"
;;
;;     The following code is generated
;;
;;     (table.select (lambda(x) (= x.|Financial Rating| {A1}))) 
;;
;;   Example Two:
;;
;;     "all (|Price| / |Earnings PS|) < 20"
;;
;;     The following code is generated
;;
;;     (table.select (lambda(x) (< (/ x.|Price| x.|Earnings PS|) 2)))
;;
;;   Example Three:
;;
;;     "all DepAccounts[].MonthEndBalance >= $10000"
;;
;;     The following code is generated
;;
;;     (table.select (lambda(x) (mapc (lambda(x) (let ((r r)) (if (>= x.MonthEndBalance $10000) (setq r true)) r)) x.DepAccounts)))
;;
;; **BOTTOM**
;;
;; The "bottom" command sorts the table in ascending order on the variable listed
;; in its arguments. After sorting, the bottom N items are selected. A fixed number
;; of items may be found or a ratio may be found. There must be at least two 
;; arguments and there may be N arguments.
;;
;;   Arguments:
;;
;;    (option One)
;;     value1      Must be a valid scalar expression.
;;     cutoff      Must be a numeric constant, a percent such as 30%, or all
;;
;;    (option Two)
;;     value1      Must be a valid scalar expression.
;;     function    Must be a valid infix operator name: + - / * exp sqr etc.
;;     valueN      Must be a valid scalar expression.
;;     cutoff      Must be a numeric constant, a percent such as 30%, or all
;;
;;   Example One:
;;
;;     "bottom Price 5"
;;
;;     The following sort/find code is generated
;;
;;     (table.sort (lambda(x y) (< x.Price y.Price))) 
;;     (table.truncate 5) 
;;
;;   Example Two: (for backward compatibility)
;;
;;     "bottom Price / |Earnings PS| 5"
;;
;;     The following sort/find code is generated
;;
;;     (table.sort (lambda(x y) (< (/ x.Price x.|Earnings PS|) (/ y.Price y.|Earnings PS|)))) 
;;     (table.truncate 5) 
;;
;;   Example Three:
;;
;;     "bottom (Price / |Earnings PS|) 5"
;;
;;     The following sort/find code is generated
;;
;;     (table.sort (lambda(x y) (< (/ x.Price x.|Earnings PS|) (/ y.Price y.|Earnings PS|)))) 
;;     (table.truncate 5) 
;;
;; **TOP**
;;
;; The "top" command sorts the table in descending order on the variable listed
;; in its arguments. It is identical to "bottom" except in sort ordering.
;;
;; **OMIT**
;;
;; The "omit" command tells the system to exclude the rows specified from
;; the current table. It is identical to "all" except it excludes instead
;; includes.
;;
;; **CRITERIA**
;;
;; The "criteria" command substitutes previously saved and named criteria,
;; specified in the named rule, in place of the criteria command. There must 
;; be at least one argument, and there may be as many as two arguments. 
;;
;;   Arguments:
;;
;;     name        Must be the valid name of a Selection or Exclusion Strategy.
;;     type        Must be either selection or exclusion. If omitted, selection
;;                 is assumed.
;;
;;   Example One:
;;
;;     Selection rule (Strong_Stocks) = "all |Financial Rating| = {A1}"
;;     Exculsion rule (Weak_Stocks)   = "omit |Technical Rank| = 5"
;;     Selection rule (Weak_Stocks)   = "all |Technical Rank| = 5"
;;
;;     "criteria,Weak_Stocks"
;;
;;     The following string results after rule substitution
;;
;;     "all |Technical Rank| = 5"
;;
;;     The following find code is generated
;;
;;     (table.select (lambda(x) (= x.|Technical Rank| 5)))
