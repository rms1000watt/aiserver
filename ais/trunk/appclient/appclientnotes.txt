							Application Client

The AppClient project generates a static library that provides a local
or remote application an interface to Lambda Internet Server (AIS).
One instance of this class is created for every context window, server message
window, browser, Flash movie, etc.  Each instance of the appclient class
keeps state about the window, and provides a set of functions that expose
the functionality that is available to all AIS clients.  Some functions
are implemented right in the client and return immediately.  Other functions
make calls to the appsvr and return asynchronously, often on a different
thread. The connection between a remote appclient and appsvr is made over
a TCP socket connection.

						APPCLIENT PROJECT
PROJECT SETUP
-------------
This project was created as follows:
1.	Compose appclient.pro by hand.  See comments in the .pro file and Qt
	Qmake.doc for more details.  One can also generate a .pro
	file using QtDesigner.
2.	Start Visual Studio. Select "Open Qt Project" icon in Qt
	add-in toolbar and select appclient.pro to create a appclient.dsp.
3.	Select File->OpenWorkspace->FileType->*.dsp. Select
	appclient.dsp to create the appclient Project.
4.	Modify project settings as noted below.  Build debug and
	release configurations.
