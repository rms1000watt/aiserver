STARTEAM FILE STATUS
In StarTeam the files are typically lumped into groups according their File Status.  Be sure to resolve
any discrepencies between the files in your local file system and those in the StartTeam server.  Do not
"check in" any files into StarTeam.  Just check out those files that are not current on your system.
If you are not familiar with the procedures for checking out a file from StarTeam, please contact IBA
support.  The status pertains to the file that is on your local file system.  Press F5 to refresh the
file status displayed to the current status.  This is most important if you have check out or deleted
any files in ais since the last time that the status was refereshed.

Current - The local file is the same as the file in the StarTeam vault.  No action is necessary.

Merge - Both the local file and the file in the StarTeam vault have been modified. To bring the local file
into conformance with the StarTeam file (local modifications will be lost), force a check out of the file.

Modified - The local copy of the file has been modified since the last time that the file was checked out.
To remove the modifications so that the file is the same as the one in StarTeam vault, force a check out.
Certain files, such as ais.ini may be intentionally modified. In this case, no action is necessary. Do
not check in your changes back into StarTeam.

Missing - A file the StarTeam vault is missing from the local file system.  Just check out these files from
StarTeam.

Not-in-View - The local file is not in the StarTeam vault. If this is a file that has been moved to another
location, it is important to delete this file from your local file system. It can and it will cause
problems if you leave it lying around.  Do not delete files in the StarTeam vault just local files.

Out-of-Date - The version in the StarTeam vault has been modified.  The outdated local file can be updated
by simply checking out the file from StarTeam.

Unknown - The file status could not be established.  Force a check out to update the local file to conform
to the version in StarTeam.
