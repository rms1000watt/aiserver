#
#                           AIS - ANALYTIC INFORMATION SERVER
# Version-specific AIS server configuration file.  Holds global user-settable parameters
# Notes:
#	 1. Do NOT modify this file. Rather, create a plain text file named ais.ini in the
#		install directory and add user-defined settings to that file using the same format
#		as used here.  Settings in your ais.ini will override the default settings shown
#		here.
#	 2.	Values of the parameters listed below can be changed in your ais.ini file.  Use
#		the same name for a parameter as listed below.  Names are case sensitive.
#	 3.	Either set AISDIR environment variable value to the path to the install directory
#		or place the .ini files in the same directory as the executable (e.g. webide.exe).
#	 4.	All paths set below are relative to the current install directory. For example,
#		the install directory for the server launched from C:\ais\webide.exe is C:\ais.
#	 5. A named value can be set using <name> = <value>. A value can be added to a
#		  comma-separated list using <name> += <value>.
#	 6. Spaces before/after the conjunction (= or +=) are ignored.
#	 7. The default value of a context-related parameter can be set here to override the
#	    default value set by the system.  Context-related parameters can also be set in
#		in the aisapp.ini file that resides in the startup directory for the application.
#		For example, the Holocene application may have an astartup.sl file and a
#		context.ini file in the directory C:\ais\holocene.  Context-specific parameters set
#		in the context.ini file will override values set in aisinstall.ini or those set in
#		ais.ini.  Parameter overrides in astartup.sl will override all of these settings.
#	 8.	Only messages with an error level > min log level are saved in a log file.
#	 9. See parameters.txt for a complete list of all parameters and a description of the
#		overrides that may be made.
#	10. An optional prefix of Win: or Linux: may be prepended to a line to specify
#       the platform

# Making updates to aisinstall.ini:
# Only the AIS administrator is allowed to make changes to an aisinstall.ini.
# Changes to the default names or values in aisinstall.ini for each release version are kept in
# changeHistory.txt which is located in the install directory.  Observe the following
# guidelines  to maintain the aisinstall.ini file:
#	 1. Note the version number shown at the top of the aisinstall.ini.
#		Note any new parameters, changes to the value or the name of existing parameters in
#		the changeHistory.txt file since the last time that that aisinstall.ini was updated.
#		 For example, suppose that the aisinstall.ini file version is 1.0035 and the
#		aisinstall.in file version is 1.0037.  Note the changes shown in changes.txt for
#		versions 1.0036 and version 1.0037.
#	 2. Include a comment at the top of the aisinstall.ini file with the latest version number
#		shown at the top of the aisinstall.ini file.  When creating/modifing the ais.ini file,
#		update the version number in the comment to the latest AIS version.
#	 3.	Modify all ais.ini files to track the latest changes as noted above.  Update
#		parameter names that have changed.  Changes to a default value may warrant the
#		addition, deletion, or modification of a parameter in the ais.ini file.  You may
#		also want add a new entry to the ais.ini file in order to modify the value of a
#		new parameter.  Add a comment at the top noting the current AIS version.
#	 4.	Repeat step 3 for all the context.ini files.
#	 5. Title format: ParamName[units] - Description [minvalue-maxvalue]

# Making updates to ais.ini
# A new release of AIS may include changes to the global and context-specific parameters.
# If the AIS administrator does not have access to  your ais.ini or context.ini file, you
# will be obliged to adapt these ini files to the changes since the last time that these
# files were updated.  Review all the entries in the current changeHistory.txt since the
# version number listed in the ini file that you are updating. Make the changes as noted in
# step 3 above.
