Initialization Steps
--------------------
 1.	Add the following path to your Path environment variable: C:\ais\bin.  Modify this path
	if your ais folder is in a different location. 
 2.	In the beginning, the global configuration parameters are set to their default values.
	The initialization files aisinstall.ini and ais.ini appear in install folder (the folder
	containing the AIS executable).  The application-specific initialization file, context.ini,
	appears in the application's working directory.  This working directory is the folder
	holding the startup file (usually astartup.sl).
 3.	The aisinstall.ini file is called to set the global configuration parameters as well as
	selected the server-wide context-specific parameters.  This file holds the parameter
	settings when the AIS system was installed.  Do not modify this file.
 4.  The ais.ini file is then read to override selected parameters set in the aisinstall.ini
	file.  This file contains the configuration settings tailored to this server.  Put
	modifications to the standard global settings here.  It is OK to modify the values, but
	the configuration names may not be modified.
 5.	Application specific parameters are set in the context.ini file found in the application's
	working directory (the directory holding the astartup.sl file for this context).
 6.  The startup file is scanned for entries of the form ;#parameter=value.  These entries
	override the settings established in the context.ini file. 


Consult the documentation in the .ini files for more information.
