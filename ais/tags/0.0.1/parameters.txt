Introduction
 Parameters.txt describes the global and context-specific parameters for Analytic Information
Servers (AIS).  A parameter setting consists of a parameter name followed by an equal sign
followed by an optional value.  An optional prefix of the form Win: or Linux: can be
prepended to specify the platform.  If the value is missing, the parameter retains its
current default value.  All parameters have a default value that is set by AIS even if no
initialization files are found.  The default value is overridden by the last parameter
setting as described below.  The parameters are broken into the following categories:
	Global Parameters
		Global configurable parameters that frequently modified (see ais.ini)
		Default global parameters that are rarely modified (see aisinstall.ini).
	Context-Specific Parameters
		Context-specific parameters that are the same for all contexts (see ais.ini)
		Context-specific parameters that are frequently modified (see context.ini)
		Context-specific parameters that are rarely modified (see below)

Setting Parameters
See the instructions in the aisinstall.ini notes for setting global parameters.  See the
instructions in context.ini for setting context-specific parameters.  The description and
sample setting may be copied from this file and pasted into the appropriate ini file.

Initialization Files
The installation files are plain text files.  Comments begin with an octothorpe (#).
Comments and blank lines are ignored.  The files are shown in the order in which they
are read.  In case that a parameter is encountered more than once, the last setting
prevails. Settings are extracted from the following places in the order listed.  Note
that both global and context-specific parameters may occur in any of the places listed
with the following provisos:
 1.	Global parameters. Only the context.ini and startup script specified by an optional
	command-line argument are checked for global parameter settings.  This feature
	allows a convenient method for overriding global port settings when starting a
	second service on the same machine (otherwise, the second instance will not start).
	Global parameter settings made by other applications are ignored.  The global
	parameters are set during the startup of an instance of AIS.  Changes made while
	the server is running are ignored until the next time that the server is started.
 2.	Context-specific parameters. Server-wide settings may be made in aisinstall.ini
	and ais.ini.  The server-wide settings are made when the server is started.
	 Selected overrides for all the startup files in a folder can be made in
	context.ini.  Finally, a startup script may include an override for one or more
	settings.  The last two sources of settings are read when the context is registered
	and again when the context is opened.

Initialization
Every parameter is set in one or more of the following ways.  The last setting in the following
list prevails.  For example, if a parameter setting is included in a startup.sl file, it
overrides any and all previous settings.  Global parameters are normally set in either
AisInstall.ini or in Ais.ini but they also may be included in context.ini or in astartup.sl.
Note that a single folder can have a context.ini file and two (or more) astartup.sl files.


HardCoded - Every parameter listed below has a hard-coded default set by a define in
globals.h.  These settings are fixed as of the last time the AIS executable was compiled.

AisInstall.ini - This file is updated and distributed as part of the AIS install package.
This file should not be modified.  Rather, to override a parameter setting, add
an entry to the ais.ini file.  The aisinstall file should reside in the installation
directory where the AIS exe file resides.  The aisinstall file contains the default
global settings and server-wide context-specific settings.

Ais.ini - This file is used to customize global and context-specific parameters for a
particular installation of AIS.  It only includes the global parameters that need to
be customized for each installation.  And, it only includes those server-wide
context-specific parameters that need to be customized to a common value for
an installation. The ais ini file should also reside in the installation directory
where the AIS exe file resides.  It contains the overrides for global parameters
and overrides for server-wide context-specific parameters.

Context.ini - This file is used to customize context-specific parameters for each
context.  It includes those context-specific parameters that must be modified
for a context.  It also may contain global parameter settings which will be used only
if the context.ini file resides in the same directory as the startup file specified on
the command line when ais is started.  The context ini file should reside in the
context's startup working directory where the context startup file resides.  It
contains the overrides that are common to all the startup scripts in the same
directory. It is included in the distribution of an update of the code for a context
but it may be customized for a specific machine.

startup.sl - The startup file may contain parmeter settings of the form:
	;#paramName=value

Parameter Descriptions
Each global and context-specific parameter is described below.  The format for a
description includes the parameter name, the units of measure, description, and range
of values:
	ParamName [units] - Description [minvalue-maxvalue]
The description is followed by an example that shows the default value for the parameter.

RIDE CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
Use Case. User may want to click on a .sl file to launch a variety of operations. Just as
for the webide parameters, parameters can be set in the following order:
1. Hard-coded default settings.
2. Settings in rideinstall.ini in the installation directory.
3. If launched from a .sl file, ride.ini settings in application working directory.
4. If launched from a .sl file, a final set of overrides in the .sl file.

RIDE OPERATIONS
RIDE parameters should allow for the following operations:
1. Connect to a specified local or remote server
2. Startup a local server as an exe or as a service if not already started
3. Connect, logon, open a context, open a session
4. Close a session in any of the standard modes
5. Close a context if opened in step 3 above
6. Shutdown a server if it was started in step 2 above
7. Disconnect from the server

CONTEXT-SPECIFIC RARELY-MODIFIED PARAMETERS
Most users will never concern themselves with these parameters settings.  They are only
included here to accommodate unusual circumstances. 

Default Value - Set by the server
Override Value - Rarely set in context.ini

# AppDefaultPage - Name of  web page served if no file name supplied in request
AppDefaultPage=

# AppDir - Topmost directory of subtree containing web accessible files
AppDir=wwwroot

# AppPort - Port number for context-specific App Server socket. [0-65535]
# Set to zero to disable global App port for this context.

# CloseMode - Default mode for closing a session when a connection is lost. [disconnect,soft,
# argument set to default. Default close mode may be soft, firm, or hard.  Soft-suspend new requests.
# Firm - suspend new and clear pending requests. Hard - suspend new, clear pending and stop
# executing current request, if any.
CloseMode=soft

# CloseWait - Default wait time (in Secs) before actually closing a session.  Used when a
# session is closed with the close mode set to default.  If CloseWait is -1, wait forever. If

# that the user is unlikely to reconnect and initiate a request that is dependent upon the
# current state.

# DefaultJitMode - Normally, the jit (Just-In-Time compiler) is turned on by default.  This means that
any lisp expression submitted to the engine is run with the jit enabled unless a prefix is prepended
to the expression that specifically turns the jit off.  On rare occasions, such as when testing a
new jit, the jit can be disabled by default so that all lisp expressions are run in emulation mode
unless a prefix is prepended to the expression that explicitly turns the jit on.  If the value
assigned to this parameter is 0 or off, by default, the jit is disabled; otherwise it is enabled.
