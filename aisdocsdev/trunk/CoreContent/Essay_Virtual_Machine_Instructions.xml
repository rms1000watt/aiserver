			   <p>The DRM virtual machine is a register machine architecture similar to most modern Von Neumann computer architectures.
		    Because the DRM virtual machine is expected to service a database, 
		    the virtual machine memory has been subdivided into dynamically typed words. 
		    Hence the name, <b>D</b>ynamic typed <b>R</b>egister <b>M</b>achine.
		    With the machine memory subdivided into dynamically typed words, data (from the database)
		    with a wide variety of types, can be easily loaded into memory; and, 
		    since the register machine architecture is similar to the internal
		    architecture of most modern computing equipment, it is easy to write
		    just-in-time compilers from DRM pcodes into native binary machine code for a
		    wide variety of computers.</p>
		    <p>The Analytic Information Server virtual machine architecture is composed of
		    the following components:</p>
		    <ul>
		      <li><b>Vector Instructions: </b>A set of vector data array instructions which
		        allow fast parallel processing of vectored integer and floating point data.</li>
		      <ul>
		        <li>Vector instructions using auxilliary signal processing and graphics chips.</li>
		        <li>Vector instructions supporting fast in-line basic linear algebra operations.</li>
		      </ul>
		      <li><b>Machine Registers: </b>A set of virtual machine arithmetic registers which
		        allow fast microchip-level execution of Lambda arithmetic operations.</li>
		      <ul>
		        <li>A set of fifty arithmetic registers.</li>
		        <li>A set of virtual machine instructions (<b>pcodes</b>) which control
		          operations in the registers.</li>
		      </ul>
		      <li><b>Main Memory:</b> A set of virtual machine words. Each virtual
		        machine word begins with a type tag and ends with a data item (this is
		        known as <b>Dynamic Typing</b>).</li>
		      <ul>
		        <li>A set of built-in data types (Integers, Strings, Vectors,
		          Structures, etc.) for storing common database data types in main
		          memory and on disk.</li>
		        <li>A set of virtual machine instructions (<b>pcodes</b>) which control
		          operations in the main memory.</li>
		      </ul>
		      <li><b>Lambdas:</b> Executable, user definable, objects known as Lambdas.
		        Lambdas can be saved and loaded from the AIS database.</li>
		      <ul>
		        <li>A set of built-in Lambda properties which allow all Lambdas to work
		          together in communities to accomplish increasingly complex tasks.</li>
		        <li>A set of built-in virtual machine functions (<b>pcodes</b>) which
		          extend operations in main memory and on disk.</li>
		      </ul>
		    </ul>
		    <p>The DRM virtual machine supports a number of registers,
		    including an Instruction Pointer register, a Stack Register, and fifty general purpose Arithmetic Registers.
		    Each general purpose arithmetic register can store Integer, IEEE floating point, or memory address data. 
		    Virtual machine instructions can operate directly on the contents of registers or on memory locations pointed to by addresses in registers.
		    Memory references can be made: (a) directly from addresses in registers; 
		    (b) indirectly from addresses in registers indexed by integers in an index register; 
		    or (c) indirectly from addresses in registers plus an inline integer displacement.
		    The virtual machine instructions operate on the following data types: 
		    </p>
		    <ul>
		    	<li>Character <i>(8-bit ASCII)</i></li>
		    	<li>Boolean <i>(8-bit true or false)</i></li>
		    	<li>Float <i>(IEEE single precision floating point)</i></li>
		    	<li>Integer <i>(32-bit signed integer - {may be 64-bit on larger computers})</i></li>
		    	<li>Number <i>(IEEE double precision floating point)</i></li>
		    	<li>Object <i>(a pointer to an AIS HEAP object {there are many different object types} such as String, Vector, Lambda, etc.)</i></li>
		    	<li>Short <i>(16-bit signed integer)</i></li>
		    	<li>Text <i>(up to 10 characters of null-terminated ASCII codes)</i></li>
		    	<li>Word <i>(128-bit dynamically typed container capable of holding any of the previous data types)</i></li>
		    </ul>
		    <h3>Word Format</h3>
		    <p>The AIS Word is a 128-bit dynamically typed container capable of holding any of the AIS native data types (shown above).
		    Each Word begins with an 80-bit data area capable of holding up to ten bytes of null-terminated ASCII text,
		    or any one of these other native AIS data types: Character, Boolean, Float, Integer, Number, Object, or Short.
		    Immediately following the Word's 80-bit data area, is the Word's tail (a 32-bit signed integer). 
		    The tail is a general purpose data field used for linking words to other words, keeping word counts, or any other purpose.
		    Immediately following the Word's tail, is the Word's Declared Type (an 8-bit data type  announcing the user's preferred data type for this Word).
		    Immediately following the Word's Declared Type, is the Word's Current Type (an 8-bit data type announcing the type of data contained in the Word's 80-bit data area). 
		    </p>
		    <h3>Assembler</h3>
		    <p>For each virtual machine instruction there is a Lisp special form which generates the specified vm instruction. 
		    This allows Lisp to perform double duty as a vm assembler language.
		    As the Analytic Information Server (AIS) virtual machine is ported from machine to machine, 
		    AIS Lisp becomes a write-once-run-anywhere assembler language.

			<P>
			AIS Lambdas are designed to be write-once-run-anywhere executable objects. 
			This is accomplished via the virtual machine concept of software Lambda execution. 
			Lambda virtual machines are designed to be mapped onto the actual host microchip at the server location, 
			providing faithful Lambda execution wherever the Lambda may travel on the Internet. 
			There are currently several virtual machines operating within Analytic Information Server. 
			The DRM virtual machine uses a Dynamically typed Register Machine model to provide portable Lambda execution 
			from high level dynamically typed instructions all the way to super fast microchip-level register execution. 
			The DRM virtual machine runs in emulation mode during the testing and debug phases of Lambda development, 
			and there is an AIS Lambda debugger available for Lambdas running on this virtual machine. 
			During the final release phases of Lambda development, DRM virtual machine Lambdas are automatically converted 
			to the NATIVE virtual machine on the host computer, using the just-in-time compiler. 
			The NATIVE virtual machine is a faithful machine language translation of the execution rules in the DRM virtual machine 
			onto the actual host microchip at the server location. 
			NATIVE virtual machine execution runs at microchip-level execution speeds.
